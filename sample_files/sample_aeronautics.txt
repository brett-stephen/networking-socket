[Line 0] [Illustration: A suggestion for applying hydrogen gas to Lana’s ‘Aerial Ship.’ Rome, 1784.]
[Line 1] With four globes of these dimensions Lana proposed to make an aerial
[Line 2] ship of the fashion shown in his quaint illustration. He is careful to point out a method by which the supporting globes for the aerial ship may be entirely emptied of air; this is to be done by connecting to each globe a tube of copper which is ‘at least a length of 47 modern Roman palmi.’ A small tap is to close this tube at the end nearest the
[Line 3] globe, and then vessel and tube are to be filled with water, after
[Line 4] which the tube is to be immersed in water and the tap opened, allowing
[Line 5] the water to run out of the vessel, while no air enters. The tap is then closed before the lower end of the tube is removed from the water,
[Line 6] leaving no air at all in the globe or sphere. Propulsion of this airship was to be accomplished by means of sails, and also by oars.
[Line 7] Lana antedated the modern propeller, and realised that the air would offer enough resistance to oars or paddle to impart motion to any vessel floating in it and propelled by these means, although he did not realise the amount of pressure on the air which would be necessary
[Line 8] to accomplish propulsion. As a matter of fact, he foresaw and provided against practically all the difficulties that would be encountered in
[Line 9] the working, as well as the making, of the aerial ship, finally coming up against what his religious training made an insuperable objection.
[Line 10] This, again, is best told in his own words:--
[Line 11]  ‘Other difficulties I do not foresee that could prevail against this
[Line 12] invention, save one only, which to me seems the greatest of them all, and that is that God would surely never allow such a machine to be
[Line 13] successful, since it would create many disturbances in the civil and
[Line 14] political governments of mankind.’
[Line 15] He ends by saying that no city would be proof against surprise, while the aerial ship could set fire to vessels at sea, and destroy houses,
[Line 16] fortresses, and cities by fire balls and bombs. In fact, at the end of
[Line 17] his treatise on the subject, he furnishes a pretty complete _résumé_ of
[Line 18] the activities of German Zeppelins.
[Line 19] As already noted, Lana himself, owing to his vows of poverty, was
[Line 20] unable to do more than put his suggestions on paper, which he did with
[Line 21] a thoroughness that has procured him a place among the really great
[Line 22] pioneers of flying.  It was nearly 200 years before any attempt was made to realise his
[Line 23] project; then, in 1843, M. Marey Monge set out to make the globes and the ship as Lana detailed them. Monge’s experiments cost him the sum
[Line 24] of 25,000 francs 75 centimes, which he expended purely from love of scientific investigation. He chose to make his globes of brass, about
[Line 25] .004 in thickness, and weighing 1.465 lbs. to the square yard. Having
[Line 26] made his sphere of this metal, he lined it with two thicknesses of
[Line 27] tissue paper, varnished it with oil, and set to work to empty it of air. This, however, he never achieved, for such metal is incapable of sustaining the pressure of the outside air, as Lana, had he had the means to carry out experiments, would have ascertained. M. Monge’s
[Line 28] sphere could never be emptied of air sufficiently to rise from the earth; it ended in the melting-pot, ignominiously enough, and all that Monge got from his experiment was the value of the scrap metal and the
[Line 29] satisfaction of knowing that Lana’s theory could never be translated into practice.
[Line 30]  Robert Hooke is less conspicuous than either Borelli or Lana; his
[Line 31] work, which came into the middle of the seventeenth century, consisted of various experiments with regard to flight, from which emerged ‘a
[Line 32] Module, which by the help of Springs and Wings, raised and sustained
[Line 33] itself in the air.’ This must be reckoned as the first model flying
[Line 34] machine which actually flew, except for da Vinci’s helicopters; Hooke’s model appears to have been of the flapping-wing type--he attempted to
[Line 35] copy the motion of birds, but found from study and experiment that
[Line 36] human muscles were not sufficient to the task of lifting the human body. For that reason, he says, ‘I applied my mind to contrive a way to make artificial muscles,’ but in this he was, as he expresses it, ‘frustrated of my expectations.’ Hooke’s claim to fame rests mainly on his successful model; the rest of his work is of too scrappy a nature
[Line 37] to rank as a serious contribution to the study of flight. 
[Line 38] Contemporary with Hooke was one Allard, who, in France, undertook to emulate the Saracen of Constantinople to a certain extent. Allard was a
[Line 39] tight-rope dancer who either did or was said to have done short gliding flights--the matter is open to question--and finally stated that he would, at St Germains, fly from the terrace in the king’s presence. He made the attempt, but merely fell, as did the Saracen some centuries before, causing himself serious injury. Allard cannot be regarded as a
[Line 40] contributor to the development of aeronautics in any way, and is only
[Line 41] mentioned as typical of the way in which, up to the time of the Wright brothers, flying was regarded. Even unto this day there are many who
[Line 42] still believe that, with a pair of wings, man ought to be able to fly,
[Line 43] and that the mathematical data necessary to effective construction simply do not exist. This attitude was reasonable enough in an
[Line 44] unlearned age, and Allard was one--a little more conspicuous than the majority--among many who made experiment in ignorance, with more or less danger to themselves and without practical result of any kind.
[Line 45]  [Illustration: Besnier’s Flying Apparatus.] 
[Line 46] The seventeenth century was not to end, however, without practical experiment of a noteworthy kind in gliding flight. Among the recruits to the ranks of pioneers was a certain Besnier, a locksmith of Sablé,
[Line 47] who somewhere between 1675 and 1680 constructed a glider of which a crude picture has come down to modern times. The apparatus, as will be seen, consisted of two rods with hinged flaps, and the original designer of the picture seems to have had but a small space in which to draw, since obviously the flaps must have been much larger than those
[Line 48] shown. Besnier placed the rods on his shoulders, and worked the flaps
[Line 49] by cords attached to his hands and feet--the flaps opened as they fell,
[Line 50] and closed as they rose, so the device as a whole must be regarded as
[Line 51] a sort of flapping glider. Having by experiment proved his apparatus successful, Besnier promptly sold it to a travelling showman of the period, and forthwith set about constructing a second set, with which
[Line 52] he made gliding flights of considerable height and distance. Like
[Line 53] Lilienthal, Besnier projected himself into space from some height, and
[Line 54] then, according to the contemporary records, he was able to cross a river of considerable size before coming to earth. It does not appear that he had any imitators, or that any advantage whatever was taken of his experiments; the age was one in which he would be regarded rather as a freak exhibitor than as a serious student, and possibly,
[Line 55] considering his origin and the sale of his first apparatus to such a client, he regarded the matter himself as more in the nature of an amusement than as a discovery.
[Line 56] Borelli, coming at the end of the century, proved to his own
[Line 57] satisfaction and that of his fellows that flapping wing flight was an impossibility; the capabilities of the plane were as yet undreamed, and
[Line 58] the prime mover that should make the plane available for flight was deep in the womb of time. Da Vinci’s work was forgotten--flight was an impossibility, or at best such a useless show as Besnier was able to give.  The eighteenth century was almost barren of experiment. Emanuel
[Line 59] Swedenborg, having invented a new religion, set about inventing a
[Line 60] flying machine, and succeeded theoretically, publishing the result of his investigations as follows:--  ‘Let a car or boat or some like object be made of light material such
[Line 61] as cork or bark, with a room within it for the operator. Secondly, in front as well as behind, or all round, set a widely-stretched sail parallel to the machine, forming within a hollow or bend, which could
[Line 62] be reefed like the sails of a ship. Thirdly, place wings on the sides, to be worked up and down by a spiral spring, these wings also to be
[Line 63] hollow below in order to increase the force and velocity, take in the air, and make the resistance as great as may be required. These, too, should be of light material and of sufficient size; they should be in the shape of birds’ wings, or the sails of a windmill, or some such shape, and should be tilted obliquely upwards, and made so as to collapse on the upward stroke and expand on the downward. Fourth, place
[Line 64] a balance or beam below, hanging down perpendicularly for some distance
[Line 65] with a small weight attached to its end, pendent exactly in line with the centre of gravity; the longer this beam is, the lighter must it be, for it must have the same proportion as the well-known vectis or
[Line 66] steel-yard. This would serve to restore the balance of the machine if
[Line 67] it should lean over to any of the four sides. Fifthly, the wings would
[Line 68] perhaps have greater force, so as to increase the resistance and make the flight easier, if a hood or shield were placed over them, as is
[Line 69] the case with certain insects. Sixthly, when the sails are expanded so as to occupy a great surface and much air, with a balance keeping
[Line 70] them horizontal, only a small force would be needed to move the machine back and forth in a circle, and up and down. And, after it has gained
[Line 71] momentum to move slowly upwards, a slight movement and an even bearing
[Line 72] would keep it balanced in the air and would determine its direction at
[Line 73] will.’ 
[Line 74] The only point in this worthy of any note is the first device for maintaining stability automatically--Swedenborg certainly scored a
[Line 75] point there. For the rest, his theory was but theory, incapable of being put to practice--he does not appear to have made any attempt at advance beyond the mere suggestion.
[Line 76]  Some ten years before his time the state of knowledge with regard to
[Line 77] flying in Europe was demonstrated by an order granted by the King of
[Line 78] Portugal to Friar Lourenzo de Guzman, who claimed to have invented a
[Line 79] flying machine capable of actual flight. The order stated that ‘In order to encourage the suppliant to apply himself with zeal toward
[Line 80] the improvement of the new machine, which is capable of producing the
[Line 81] effects mentioned by him, I grant unto him the first vacant place in
[Line 82] my College of Barcelos or Santarem, and the first professorship of
[Line 83] mathematics in my University of Coimbra, with the annual pension of
[Line 84] 600,000 reis during his life.--Lisbon, 17th of March, 1709.’
[Line 85] What happened to Guzman when the non-existence of the machine was discovered is one of the things that is well outside the province of
[Line 86] aeronautics. He was charlatan pure and simple, as far as actual flight was concerned, though he had some ideas respecting the design of hot-air balloons, according to Tissandier. (_La Navigation Aerienne._) His flying machine was to contain, among other devices, bellows to
[Line 87] produce artificial wind when the real article failed, and also magnets
[Line 88] in globes to draw the vessel in an upward direction and maintain its
[Line 89] buoyancy. Some draughtsman, apparently gifted with as vivid imagination as Guzman himself, has given to the world an illustration of the hypothetical vessel; it bears some resemblance to Lana’s aerial ship, from which fact one draws obvious conclusions.
[Line 90] A rather amusing claim to solving the problem of flight was made in the middle of the eighteenth century by one Grimaldi, a ‘famous
[Line 91] and unique Engineer’ who, as a matter of actual fact, spent twenty
[Line 92] years in missionary work in India, and employed the spare time that
[Line 93] missionary work left him in bringing his invention to a workable state.
[Line 94] The invention is described as a ‘box which with the aid of clockwork rises in the air, and goes with such lightness and strong rapidity that it succeeds in flying a journey of seven leagues in an hour. It
[Line 95] is made in the fashion of a bird; the wings from end to end are 25 feet in extent. The body is composed of cork, artistically joined together and well fastened with metal wire, covered with parchment and feathers. The wings are made of catgut and whalebone, and covered
[Line 96] also with the same parchment and feathers, and each wing is folded
[Line 97] in three seams. In the body of the machine are contained thirty
[Line 98] wheels of unique work, with two brass globes and little chains which
[Line 99] alternately wind up a counterpoise; with the aid of six brass vases,
[Line 100] full of a certain quantity of quicksilver, which run in some pulleys, the machine is kept by the artist in due equilibrium and balance. By means, then, of the friction between a steel wheel adequately tempered and a very heavy and surprising piece of lodestone, the whole is kept
[Line 101] in a regulated forward movement, given, however, a right state of the
[Line 102] winds, since the machine cannot fly so much in totally calm weather as in stormy. This prodigious machine is directed and guided by a tail
[Line 103] seven palmi long, which is attached to the knees and ankles of the
[Line 104] inventor by leather straps; by stretching out his legs, either to the
[Line 105] right or to the left, he moves the machine in whichever direction he
[Line 106] pleases.... The machine’s flight lasts only three hours, after which
[Line 107] the wings gradually close themselves, when the inventor, perceiving this, goes down gently, so as to get on his own feet, and then winds
[Line 108] up the clockwork and gets himself ready again upon the wings for the
[Line 109] continuation of a new flight. He himself told us that if by chance one of the wheels came off or if one of the wings broke, it is certain he
[Line 110] would inevitably fall rapidly to the ground, and, therefore, he does not rise more than the height of a tree or two, as also he only once put himself in the risk of crossing the sea, and that was from Calais to Dover, and the same morning he arrived in London.’  And yet there are still quite a number of people who persist in stating
[Line 111] that Bleriot was the first man to fly across the Channel! 
[Line 112] A study of the development of the helicopter principle was published in France in 1868, when the great French engineer Paucton produced his
[Line 113] _Théorie de la Vis d’Archiméde_. For some inexplicable reason, Paucton was not satisfied with the term ‘helicopter,’ but preferred to call it
[Line 114] a ‘ptérophore,’ a name which, so far as can be ascertained, has not been adopted by any other writer or investigator. Paucton stated that,
[Line 115] since a man is capable of sufficient force to overcome the weight of his own body, it is only necessary to give him a machine which acts on
[Line 116] the air ‘with all the force of which it is capable and at its utmost speed,’ and he will then be able to lift himself in the air, just as by the exertion of all his strength he is able to lift himself in water. ‘It would seem,’ says Paucton, ‘that in the ptérophore, attached vertically to a carriage, the whole built lightly and carefully
[Line 117] assembled, he has found something that will give him this result in all
[Line 118] perfection. In construction, one would be careful that the machine
[Line 119] produced the least friction possible, and naturally it ought to produce little, as it would not be at all complicated. The new Dædalus, sitting comfortably in his carriage, would by means of a crank give to the
[Line 120] ptérophore a suitable circular (or revolving) speed. This single
[Line 121] ptérophore would lift him vertically, but in order to move horizontally
[Line 122] he should be supplied with a tail in the shape of another ptérophore. When he wished to stop for a little time, valves fixed firmly across
[Line 123] the end of the space between the blades would automatically close the openings through which the air flows, and change the ptérophore into an unbroken surface which would resist the flow of air and retard the fall of the machine to a considerable degree.’  The doctrine thus set forth might appear plausible, but it is based
[Line 124] on the common misconception that all the force which might be put into the helicopter or ‘ptérophore’ would be utilised for lifting
[Line 125] or propelling the vehicle through the air, just as a propeller uses
[Line 126] all its power to drive a ship through water. But, in applying such
[Line 127] a propelling force to the air, most of the force is utilised in maintaining aerodynamic support--as a matter of fact, more force is
[Line 128] needed to maintain this support than the muscle of man could possibly furnish to a lifting screw, and even if the helicopter were applied
[Line 129] to a full-sized, engine-driven air vehicle, the rate of ascent would
[Line 130] depend on the amount of surplus power that could be carried. For
[Line 131] example, an upward lift of 1,000 pounds from a propeller 15 feet in
[Line 132] diameter would demand an expenditure of 50 horse-power under the best possible conditions, and in order to lift this load vertically through
[Line 133] such atmospheric pressure as exists at sea-level or thereabouts, an
[Line 134] additional 20 horse-power would be required to attain a rate of 11 feet per second--50 horse-power must be continually provided for the mere support of the load, and the additional 20 horse-power must be continually provided in order to lift it. Although, in model form,
[Line 135] there is nothing quite so strikingly successful as the helicopter in
[Line 136] the range of flying machines, yet the essential weight increases so disproportionately to the effective area that it is necessary to go but
[Line 137] very little beyond model dimensions for the helicopter to become quite
[Line 138] ineffective.
[Line 139] That is not to say that the lifting screw must be totally ruled out
[Line 140] so far as the construction of aircraft is concerned. Much is still
[Line 141] empirical, so far as this branch of aeronautics is concerned, and consideration of the structural features of a propeller goes to show that the relations of essential weight and effective area do not
[Line 142] altogether apply in practice as they stand in theory. Paucton’s dream,
[Line 143] in some modified form, may yet become reality--it is only so short a time ago as 1896 that Lord Kelvin stated he had not the smallest
[Line 144] molecule of faith in aerial navigation, and since the whole history of flight consists in proving the impossible possible, the helicopter may yet challenge the propelled plane surface for aerial supremacy.  It does not appear that Paucton went beyond theory, nor is there in his theory any advance toward practical flight--da Vinci could have told him as much as he knew. He was followed by Meerwein, who invented an apparatus apparently something between a flapping wing machine
[Line 145] and a glider, consisting of two wings, which were to be operated by
[Line 146] means of a rod; the venturesome one who would fly by means of this
[Line 147] apparatus had to lie in a horizontal position beneath the wings to work
[Line 148] the rod. Meerwein deserves a place of mention, however, by reason of his investigations into the amount of surface necessary to support a given weight. Taking that weight at 200 pounds--which would allow for
[Line 149] the weight of a man and a very light apparatus--he estimated that 126
[Line 150] square feet would be necessary for support. His pamphlet, published
[Line 151] at Basle in 1784, shows him to have been a painstaking student of the
[Line 152] potentialities of flight.
[Line 153]  Jean-Pierre Blanchard, later to acquire fame in connection with balloon flight, conceived and described a curious vehicle, of which he even announced trials as impending. His trials were postponed time
[Line 154] after time, and it appears that he became convinced in the end of the futility of his device, being assisted to such a conclusion by
[Line 155] Lalande, the astronomer, who repeated Borelli’s statement that it was
[Line 156] impossible for man ever to fly by his own strength. This was in the closing days of the French monarchy, and the ascent of the Mongolfiers’ first hot-air balloon in 1783--which shall be told more fully in its place--put an end to all French experiments with heavier-than-air apparatus, though in England the genius of Cayley was about to bud, and even in France there were those who understood that ballooning was not
[Line 157] true flight. 
[Line 158] III  SIR GEORGE CAYLEY--THOMAS WALKER 
[Line 159]  On the fifth of June, 1783, the Montgolfiers’ hot-air balloon rose at Versailles, and in its rising divided the study of the conquest
[Line 160] of the air into two definite parts, the one being concerned with the
[Line 161] propulsion of gas lifted, lighter-than-air vehicles, and the other being crystallised in one sentence by Sir George Cayley: ‘The whole
[Line 162] problem,’ he stated, ‘is confined within these limits, viz.: to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the
[Line 163] resistance of the air.’ For about ten years the balloon held the field entirely, being regarded as the only solution of the problem of flight that man could ever compass. So definite for a time was this view on
[Line 164] the eastern side of the Channel that for some years practically all the progress that was made in the development of power-driven planes was made in Britain.
[Line 165]  In 1800 a certain Dr Thomas Young demonstrated that certain curved surfaces suspended by a thread moved into and not away from a
[Line 166] horizontal current of air, but the demonstration, which approaches
[Line 167] perilously near to perpetual motion if the current be truly horizontal, has never been successfully repeated, so that there is more than a suspicion that Young’s air-current was _not_ horizontal. Others had
[Line 168] made and were making experiments on the resistance offered to the air
[Line 169] by flat surfaces, when Cayley came to study and record, earning such a place among the pioneers as to win the title of ‘father of British aeronautics.’  Cayley was a man in advance of his time, in many ways. Of independent
[Line 170] means, he made the grand tour which was considered necessary to the
[Line 171] education of every young man of position, and during this excursion he was more engaged in studies of a semi-scientific character than in the pursuits that normally filled such a period. His various writings
[Line 172] prove that throughout his life aeronautics was the foremost subject
[Line 173] in his mind; the _Mechanic’s Magazine_, _Nicholson’s Journal_, the _Philosophical Magazine_, and other periodicals of like nature bear
[Line 174] witness to Cayley’s continued research into the subject of flight.
[Line 175] He approached the subject after the manner of the trained scientist,
[Line 176] analysing the mechanical properties of air under chemical and physical
[Line 177] action. Then he set to work to ascertain the power necessary for aerial
[Line 178] flight, and was one of the first to enunciate the fallacy of the hopes
[Line 179] of successful flight by means of the steam engine of those days, owing to the fact that it was impossible to obtain a given power with a given weight.
[Line 180]  Yet his conclusions on this point were not altogether negative, for as early as 1810 he stated that he could construct a balloon which could travel with passengers at 20 miles an hour--he was one of the first
[Line 181] to consider the possibilities of applying power to a balloon. Nearly
[Line 182] thirty years later--in 1837--he made the first attempt at establishing
[Line 183] an aeronautical society, but at that time the power-driven plane was regarded by the great majority as an absurd dream of more or less
[Line 184] mad inventors, while ballooning ranked on about the same level as
[Line 185] tight-rope walking, being considered an adjunct to fairs and fêtes, more a pastime than a study.
[Line 186] Up to the time of his death, in 1857, Cayley maintained his study of aeronautical matters, and there is no doubt whatever that his work
[Line 187] went far in assisting the solution of the problem of air conquest. His
[Line 188] principal published work, a monograph entitled _Aerial Navigation_, has
[Line 189] been republished in the admirable series of ‘Aeronautical Classics’ issued by the Royal Aeronautical Society. He began this work by pointing out the impossibility of flying by means of attached wrings,
[Line 190] an impossibility due to the fact that, while the pectoral muscles of a bird account for more than two-thirds of its whole muscular strength, in a man the muscles available for flying, no matter what mechanism might be used, would not exceed one-tenth of his total strength.
[Line 191]  Cayley did not actually deny the possibility of a man flying by muscular effort, however, but stated that ‘the flight of a strong man by great muscular exertion, though a curious and interesting circumstance, inasmuch as it will probably be the means of ascertaining this power and supplying the basis whereon to improve it, would be of
[Line 192] little use.’  From this he goes on to the possibility of using a Boulton and Watt steam engine to develop the power necessary for flight, and in this
[Line 193] he saw a possibility of practical result. It is worthy of note that
[Line 194] in this connection he made mention of the forerunner of the modern internal combustion engine; ‘The French,’ he said, ‘have lately shown the great power produced by igniting inflammable powders in closed vessels, and several years ago an engine was made to work in this
[Line 195] country in a similar manner by inflammation of spirit of tar.’ In a
[Line 196] subsequent paragraph of his monograph he anticipates almost exactly the construction of the Lenoir gas engine, which came into being more than
[Line 197] fifty-five years after his monograph was published. 
[Line 198] Certain experiments detailed in his work were made to ascertain the size of the surface necessary for the support of any given weight. He accepted a truism of to-day in pointing out that in any matters
[Line 199] connected with aerial investigation, theory and practice are as
[Line 200] widely apart as the poles. Inclined at first to favour the helicopter
[Line 201] principle, he finally rejected this in favour of the plane, with which he made numerous experiments. During these, he ascertained the peculiar advantages of curved surfaces, and saw the necessity of providing both vertical and horizontal rudders in order to admit of side steering as well as the control of ascent and descent, and for
[Line 202] preserving equilibrium. He may be said to have anticipated the work of
[Line 203] Lilienthal and Pilcher, since he constructed and experimented with a fixed surface glider. ‘It was beautiful,’ he wrote concerning this, ‘to see this noble white bird sailing majestically from the top of a hill
[Line 204] to any given point of the plain below it with perfect steadiness and safety, according to the set of its rudder, merely by its own weight,
[Line 205] descending at an angle of about eight degrees with the horizon.’ 
[Line 206] [Illustration: Sir George Caley, Bart.
[Line 207]  ‘The Father of British Aeronautics.’]
[Line 208]  It is said that he once persuaded his gardener to trust himself in this
[Line 209] glider for a flight, but if Cayley himself ventured a flight in it he
[Line 210] has left no record of the fact. The following extract from his work, _Aerial Navigation_, affords an instance of the thoroughness of his investigations, and the concluding paragraph also shows his faith in the ultimate triumph of mankind in the matter of aerial flight:--
[Line 211] ‘The act of flying requires less exertion than from the appearance is
[Line 212] supposed. Not having sufficient data to ascertain the exact degree of
[Line 213] propelling power exerted by birds in the act of flying, it is uncertain
[Line 214] what degree of energy may be required in this respect for vessels of
[Line 215] aerial navigation; yet when we consider the many hundreds of miles of
[Line 216] continued flight exerted by birds of passage, the idea of its being only a small effort is greatly corroborated. To apply the power of
[Line 217] the first mover to the greatest advantage in producing this effect is
[Line 218] a very material point. The mode universally adopted by Nature is the
[Line 219] oblique waft of the wing. We have only to choose between the direct
[Line 220] beat overtaking the velocity of the current, like the oar of a boat, or
[Line 221] one applied like the wing, in some assigned degree of obliquity to it.
[Line 222] Suppose 35 feet per second to be the velocity of an aerial vehicle, the oar must be moved with this speed previous to its being able to receive
[Line 223] any resistance; then if it be only required to obtain a pressure of
[Line 224] one-tenth of a lb. upon each square foot it must exceed the velocity of the current 7.3 feet per second. Hence its whole velocity must be
[Line 225] 42.5 feet per second. Should the same surface be wafted downward like a
[Line 226] wing with the hinder edge inclined upward in an angle of about 50 deg. 40 feet to the current it will overtake it at a velocity of 3.5 feet
[Line 227] per second; and as a slight unknown angle of resistance generates a lb.
[Line 228] pressure per square foot at this velocity, probably a waft of a little
[Line 229] more than 4 feet per second would produce this effect, one-tenth part
[Line 230] of which would be the propelling power. The advantage of this mode of application compared with the former is rather more than ten to one. 
[Line 231] ‘In continuing the general principles of aerial navigation, for the
[Line 232] practice of the art, many mechanical difficulties present themselves
[Line 233] which require a considerable course of skilfully applied experiments
[Line 234] before they can be overcome; but, to a certain extent, the air has already been made navigable, and no one who has seen the steadiness
[Line 235] with which weights to the amount of ten stone (including four stone,
[Line 236] the weight of the machine) hover in the air can doubt of the ultimate
[Line 237] accomplishment of this object.’ 
[Line 238] This extract from his work gives but a faint idea of the amount of
[Line 239] research for which Cayley was responsible. He had the humility of the true investigator in scientific problems, and so far as can be seen was never guilty of the great fault of so many investigators in this
[Line 240] subject--that of making claims which he could not support. He was content to do, and pass after having recorded his part, and although
[Line 241] nearly half a century had to pass between the time of his death and the first actual flight by means of power-driven planes, yet he may be said to have contributed very largely to the solution of the problem, and
[Line 242] his name will always rank high in the roll of the pioneers of flight.  Practically contemporary with Cayley was Thomas Walker, concerning whom little is known save that he was a portrait painter of Hull, where was published his pamphlet on _The Art of Flying_ in 1810, a second and amplified edition being produced, also in Hull, in 1831. The pamphlet,
[Line 243] which has been reproduced _in extenso_ in the _Aeronautical Classics_ series published by the Royal Aeronautical Society, displays a curious mixture of the true scientific spirit and colossal conceit. Walker
[Line 244] appears to have been a man inclined to jump to conclusions, which
[Line 245] carried him up to the edge of discovery and left him vacillating there.  The study of the two editions of his pamphlet side by side shows that
[Line 246] their author made considerable advances in the practicability of
[Line 247] his designs in the 21 intervening years, though the drawings which
[Line 248] accompany the text in both editions fail to show anything really capable of flight. The great point about Walker’s work as a whole is its suggestiveness; he did not hesitate to state that the ‘art’ of
[Line 249] flying is as truly mechanical as that of rowing a boat, and he had some conception of the necessary mechanism, together with an absolute
[Line 250] conviction that he knew all there was to be known. ‘Encouraged by the
[Line 251] public,’ he says, ‘I would not abandon my purpose of making still further exertions to advance and complete an art, the discovery of the _true principles_ (the italics are Walker’s own) of which, I trust, I
[Line 252] can with certainty affirm to be my own.’
[Line 253] The pamphlet begins with Walker’s admiration of the mechanism of flight as displayed by birds. ‘It is now almost twenty years,’ he says, ‘since I was first led to think, by the study of birds and their means of
[Line 254] flying, that if an artificial machine were formed with wings in exact
[Line 255] imitation of the mechanism of one of those beautiful living machines, and applied in the very same way upon the air, there could be no doubt
[Line 256] of its being made to fly, for it is an axiom in philosophy that the same cause will ever produce the same effect.’ With this he confesses his inability to produce the said effect through lack of funds, though he clothes this delicately in the phrase ‘professional avocations and
[Line 257] other circumstances.’ Owing to this inability he published his designs
[Line 258] that others might take advantage of them, prefacing his own researches
[Line 259] with a list of the very early pioneers, and giving special mention to
[Line 260] Friar Bacon, Bishop Wilkins, and the Portuguese friar, De Guzman. But,
[Line 261] although he seems to suggest that others should avail themselves of his theoretical knowledge, there is a curious incompleteness about the
[Line 262] designs accompanying his work, and about the work itself, which seems to suggest that he had more knowledge to impart than he chose to make public--or else that he came very near to complete solution of the problem of flight, and stayed on the threshold without knowing it. 
[Line 263] After a dissertation upon the history and strength of the condor,
[Line 264] and on the differences between the weights of birds, he says: ‘The following observations upon the wonderful difference in the weight of some birds, with their apparent means of supporting it in their flight, may tend to remove some prejudices against my plan from the minds of some of my readers. The weight of the humming-bird is one drachm, that of the condor not less than four stone. Now, if we reduce four stone into drachms we shall find the condor is 14,336 times as heavy as the
[Line 265] humming-bird. What an amazing disproportion of weight! Yet by the
[Line 266] same mechanical use of its wings the condor can overcome the specific
[Line 267] gravity of its body with as much ease as the little humming-bird. But
[Line 268] this is not all. We are informed that this enormous bird possesses a
[Line 269] power in its wings, so far exceeding what is necessary for its own
[Line 270] conveyance through the air, that it can take up and fly away with a whole sheep in its talons, with as much ease as an eagle would carry
[Line 271] off, in the same manner, a hare or a rabbit. This we may readily give credit to, from the known fact of our little kestrel and the
[Line 272] sparrowhawk frequently flying off with a partridge, which is nearly three times the weight of these rapacious little birds.’
[Line 273]  After a few more observations he arrives at the following conclusion:
[Line 274] ‘By attending to the progressive increase in the weight of birds, from
[Line 275] the delicate little humming-bird up to the huge condor, we clearly discover that the addition of a few ounces, pounds, or stones, is no obstacle to the art of flying; the specific weight of birds avails nothing, for by their possessing wings large enough, and sufficient
[Line 276] power to work them, they can accomplish the means of flying equally well upon all the various scales and dimensions which we see in nature. Such being a fact, in the name of reason and philosophy why shall not man, with a pair of artificial wings, large enough, and with sufficient
[Line 277] power to strike them upon the air, be able to produce the same effect?’
[Line 278]  Walker asserted definitely and with good ground that muscular effort applied without mechanism is insufficient for human flight, but he states that if an aeronautical boat were constructed so that a man could sit in it in the same manner as when rowing, such a man would
[Line 279] be able to bring into play his whole bodily strength for the purpose of flight, and at the same time would be able to get an additional advantage by exerting his strength upon a lever. At first he concluded there must be expansion of wings large enough to resist in a sufficient degree the specific gravity of whatever is attached to them, but in
[Line 280] the second edition of his work he altered this to ‘expansion of flat
[Line 281] passive surfaces large enough to reduce the force of gravity so as to float the machine upon the air with the man in it.’ The second
[Line 282] requisite is strength enough to strike the wings with sufficient force to complete the buoyancy and give a projectile motion to the machine.
[Line 283] Given these two requisites, Walker states definitely that flying must be accomplished simply by muscular exertion. ‘If we are secure of these two requisites, and I am very confident we are, we may calculate upon
[Line 284] the success of flight with as much certainty as upon our walking.’
[Line 285]  Walker appears to have gained some confidence from the experiments
[Line 286] of a certain M. Degen, a watchmaker of Vienna, who, according to the
[Line 287] _Monthly Magazine_ of September, 1809, invented a machine by means of
[Line 288] which a person might raise himself into the air. The said machine, according to the magazine, was formed of two parachutes which might be folded up or extended at pleasure, while the person who worked them was
[Line 289] placed in the centre. This account, however, was rather misleading, for the magazine carefully avoided mention of a balloon to which the inventor fixed his wings or parachutes. Walker, knowing nothing of the balloon, concluded that Degen actually raised himself in the air,
[Line 290] though he is doubtful of the assertion that Degen managed to fly in
[Line 291] various directions, especially against the wind.
[Line 292]  Walker, after considering Degen and all his works, proceeds to detail his own directions for the construction of a flying machine, these
[Line 293] being as follows: ‘Make a car of as light material as possible, but with sufficient strength to support a man in it; provide a pair of wings about four feet each in length; let them be horizontally expanded and fastened upon the top edge of each side of the car, with two joints each, so as to admit of a vertical motion to the wings, which motion may be effected by a man sitting and working an upright lever in
[Line 294] the middle of the car. Extend in the front of the car a flat surface of
[Line 295] silk, which must be stretched out and kept fixed in a passive state; there must be the same fixed behind the car; these two surfaces must
[Line 296] be perfectly equal in length and breadth and large enough to cover a sufficient quantity of air to support the whole weight as nearly in
[Line 297] equilibrium as possible, thus we shall have a great sustaining power
[Line 298] in those passive surfaces and the active wings will propel the car
[Line 299] forward.’ 
[Line 300] A description of how to launch this car is subsequently given: ‘It
[Line 301] becomes necessary,’ says the theorist, ‘that I should give directions how it may be launched upon the air, which may be done by various means; perhaps the following method may be found to answer as well as
[Line 302] any: Fix a poll upright in the earth, about twenty feet in height,
[Line 303] with two open collars to admit another poll to slide upwards through them; let there be a sliding platform made fast upon the top of the sliding poll; place the car with a man in it upon the platform, then
[Line 304] raise the platform to the height of about thirty feet by means of the sliding poll, let the sliding poll and platform suddenly fall down, the car will then be left upon the air, and by its pressing the air a projectile force will instantly propel the car forward; the man in
[Line 305] the car must then strike the active wings briskly upon the air, which
[Line 306] will so increase the projectile force as to become superior to the
[Line 307] force of gravitation, and if he inclines his weight a little backward,
[Line 308] the projectile impulse will drive the car forward in an ascending
[Line 309] direction. When the car is brought to a sufficient altitude to clear the tops of hills, trees, buildings, etc., the man, by sitting a little
[Line 310] forward on his seat, will then bring the wings upon a horizontal plane,
[Line 311] and by continuing the action of the wings he will be impelled forward in that direction. To descend, he must desist from striking the wings, and hold them on a level with their joints; the car will then gradually
[Line 312] come down, and when it is within five or six feet of the ground the man
[Line 313] must instantly strike the wings downwards, and sit as far back as he can; he will by this means check the projectile force, and cause the
[Line 314] car to alight very gently with a retrograde motion. The car, when up in the air, may be made to turn to the right or to the left by forcing
[Line 315] out one of the fins, having one about eighteen inches long placed vertically on each side of the car for that purpose, or perhaps merely
[Line 316] by the man inclining the weight of his body to one side.’
[Line 317]  Having stated how the thing is to be done, Walker is careful to explain
[Line 318] that when it is done there will be in it some practical use, notably
[Line 319] in respect of the conveyance of mails and newspapers, or the saving of
[Line 320] life at sea, or for exploration, etc. It might even reduce the number of horses kept by man for his use, by means of which a large amount of
[Line 321] land might be set free for the growth of food for human consumption. 
[Line 322] At the end of his work Walker admits the idea of steam power for
[Line 323] driving a flying machine in place of simple human exertion, but he,
[Line 324] like Cayley, saw a drawback to this in the weight of the necessary
[Line 325] engine. On the whole, he concluded, navigation of the air by means of
[Line 326] engine power would be mostly confined to the construction of navigable
[Line 327] balloons.
[Line 328] As already noted, Walker’s work is not over practical, and the
[Line 329] foregoing extract includes the most practical part of it; the rest is a series of dissertations on bird flight, in which, evidently, the portrait painter’s observations were far less thorough than those of da Vinci or Borelli. Taken on the whole, Walker was a man with a
[Line 330] hobby; he devoted to it much time and thought, but it remained a hobby,
[Line 331] nevertheless. His observations have proved useful enough to give him a
[Line 332] place among the early students of flight, but a great drawback to his work is the lack of practical experiment, by means of which alone real
[Line 333] advance could be made; for, as Cayley admitted, theory and practice are very widely separated in the study of aviation, and the whole history of flight is a matter of unexpected results arising from scarcely
[Line 334] foreseen causes, together with experiment as patient as daring. 
[Line 335] IV
[Line 336] THE MIDDLE NINETEENTH CENTURY
[Line 337]   Both Cayley and Walker were theorists, though Cayley supported his
[Line 338] theoretical work with enough of practice to show that he studied along right lines; a little after his time there came practical men
[Line 339] who brought to being the first machine which actually flew by the
[Line 340] application of power. Before their time, however, mention must be made
[Line 341] of the work of George Pocock of Bristol, who, somewhere about 1840,
[Line 342] invented what was described as a ‘kite carriage,’ a vehicle which carried a number of persons, and obtained its motive power from a large kite. It is on record that, in the year 1846, one of these carriages
[Line 343] conveyed sixteen people from Bristol to London. Another device of
[Line 344] Pocock’s was what he called a ‘buoyant sail,’ which was in effect a man-lifting kite, and by means of which a passenger was actually
[Line 345] raised 100 yards from the ground, while the inventor’s son scaled a
[Line 346] cliff 200 feet in height by means of one of these ‘buoyant sails.’ This constitutes the first definitely recorded experiment in the use of man-lifting kites. _A History of the Charvolant or Kite-Carriage_, published in London in 1851, states that ‘an experiment of a bold
[Line 347] and very novel character was made upon an extensive down, where a
[Line 348] large wagon with a considerable load was drawn along, whilst this huge machine at the same time carried an observer aloft in the air, realising almost the romance of flying.’
[Line 349]  Experimenting, two years after the appearance of the ‘kite-carriage,’ on the helicopter principle, W. H. Phillips constructed a model
[Line 350] machine which weighed two pounds; this was fitted with revolving fans,
[Line 351] driven by the combustion of charcoal, nitre, and gypsum, producing
[Line 352] steam which, discharging into the air, caused the fans to revolve.
[Line 353] The inventor stated that ‘all being arranged, the steam was up in a
[Line 354] few seconds, when the whole apparatus spun around like any top, and mounted into the air faster than a bird; to what height it ascended I had no means of ascertaining; the distance travelled was across
[Line 355] two fields, where, after a long search, I found the machine minus the wings, which had been torn off in contact with the ground.’ This
[Line 356] could hardly be described as successful flight, but it was an advance in the construction of machines on the helicopter principle, and it
[Line 357] was the first steam-driven model of the type which actually flew. The
[Line 358] invention, however, was not followed up. 
[Line 359] After Phillips, we come to the great figures of the middle nineteenth
[Line 360] century, W. S. Henson and John Stringfellow. Cayley had shown, in 1809, how success might be attained by developing the idea of the plane surface so driven as to take advantage of the resistance offered by
[Line 361] the air, and Henson, who as early as 1840 was experimenting with model gliders and light steam engines, evolved and patented an idea for something very nearly resembling the monoplane of the early twentieth century. His patent, No. 9478, of the year 1842, explains the principle of the machine as follows:--
[Line 362]  ‘In order that the description hereafter given may be rendered clear,
[Line 363] I will first shortly explain the principle on which the machine is constructed. If any light and flat or nearly flat article be projected or thrown edgewise in a slightly inclined position, the same will rise on the air till the force exerted is expended, when the article
[Line 364] so thrown or projected will descend; and it will readily be conceived
[Line 365] that, if the article so projected or thrown possessed in itself a
[Line 366] continuous power or force equal to that used in throwing or projecting it, the article would continue to ascend so long as the forward part of the surface was upwards in respect to the hinder part, and that such article, when the power was stopped, or when the inclination was
[Line 367] reversed, would descend by gravity aided by the force of the power
[Line 368] contained in the article, if the power be continued, thus imitating the
[Line 369] flight of a bird.
[Line 370] [Illustration: Henson’s proposed flying machine.]
[Line 371] [Illustration: Stringfellow’s power-driven model--the first model to achieve engine-driven flight.]  Now, the first part of my invention consists of an apparatus so constructed as to offer a very extended surface or plane of a light yet strong construction, which will have the same relation to the general machine which the extended wings of a bird have to the body when a
[Line 372] bird is skimming in the air; but in place of the movement or power for onward progress being obtained by movement of the extended surface or plane, as is the case with the wings of birds, I apply suitable paddle-wheels or other proper mechanical propellers worked by a steam or other sufficiently light engine, and thus obtain the requisite
[Line 373] power for onward movement to the plane or extended surface; and in
[Line 374] order to give control as to the upward and downward direction of such a machine I apply a tail to the extended surface which is capable of being inclined or raised, so that when the power is acting to propel
[Line 375] the machine, by inclining the tail upwards, the resistance offered
[Line 376] by the air will cause the machine to rise on the air; and, on the contrary, when the inclination of the tail is reversed, the machine will immediately be propelled downwards, and pass through a plane more or less inclined to the horizon as the inclination of the tail is greater or less; and in order to guide the machine as to the lateral
[Line 377] direction which it shall take, I apply a vertical rudder or second tail, and, according as the same is inclined in one direction or the
[Line 378] other, so will be the direction of the machine.’
[Line 379] The machine in question was very large, and differed very little from
[Line 380] the modern monoplane; the materials were to be spars of bamboo and hollow wood, with diagonal wire bracing. The surface of the planes was
[Line 381] to amount to 4,500 square feet, and the tail, triangular in form (here
[Line 382] modern practice diverges) was to be 1,500 square feet. The inventor estimated that there would be a sustaining power of half a pound per
[Line 383] square foot, and the driving power was to be supplied by a steam engine of 25 to 30 horse-power, driving two six-bladed propellers. Henson was
[Line 384] largely dependent on Stringfellow for many details of his design, more especially with regard to the construction of the engine.
[Line 385]  The publication of the patent attracted a great amount of public attention, and the illustrations in contemporary journals, representing the machine flying over the pyramids and the Channel, anticipated
[Line 386] fact by sixty years and more; the scientific world was divided, as it was up to the actual accomplishment of flight, as to the value of the
[Line 387] invention.
[Line 388] Stringfellow and Henson became associated, after the conception of
[Line 389] their design, with an attorney named Colombine, and a Mr Marriott, and between the four of them a project grew for putting the whole thing on
[Line 390] a commercial basis--Henson and Stringfellow were to supply the idea; Marriott, knowing a member of Parliament, would be useful in getting a
[Line 391] company incorporated, and Colombine would look after the purely legal side of the business. Thus an application was made by Mr Roebuck,
[Line 392] Marriott’s M.P., for an act of incorporation for ‘The Aerial Steam
[Line 393] Transit Company,’ Roebuck moving to bring in the bill on the 24th of March, 1843. The prospectus, calling for funds for the development of the invention, makes interesting reading at this stage of aeronautical
[Line 394] development; it was as follows:-- 
[Line 395]   PROPOSAL.
[Line 396]    For subscriptions of sums of £100, in furtherance of an   Extraordinary Invention not at present safe to be developed by   securing the necessary Patents, for which three times the sum
[Line 397]   advanced, namely, £300, is conditionally guaranteed for each
[Line 398]   subscription on February 1, 1844, in case of the anticipations
[Line 399]   being realised, with the option of the subscribers being   shareholders for the large amount if so desired, but not otherwise. 
[Line 400]        *       *       *       *       *
[Line 401]   An Invention has recently been discovered, which if ultimately   successful will be without parallel even in the age which   introduced to the world the wonderful effects of gas and of steam.
[Line 402]    The discovery is of that peculiar nature, so simple in principle
[Line 403]   yet so perfect in all the ingredients required for complete and
[Line 404]   permanent success, that to promulgate it at present would wholly
[Line 405]   defeat its development by the immense competition which would
[Line 406]   ensue, and the views of the originator be entirely frustrated. 
[Line 407]   This work, the result of years of labour and study, presents a
[Line 408]   wonderful instance of the adaptation of laws long since proved   to the scientific world combined with established principles so
[Line 409]   judiciously and carefully arranged, as to produce a discovery   perfect in all its parts and alike in harmony with the laws of
[Line 410]   Nature and of science.
[Line 411]    The Invention has been subjected to several tests and examinations   and the results are most satisfactory, so much so that nothing
[Line 412]   but the completion of the undertaking is required to determine   its practical operation, which being once established its utility   is undoubted, as it would be a necessary possession of every   empire, and it were hardly too much to say, of every individual of
[Line 413]   competent means in the civilised world.    Its qualities and capabilities are so vast that it were impossible   and, even if possible, unsafe to develop them further, but some   idea may be formed from the fact that as a preliminary measure   patents in Great Britain, Ireland, Scotland, the Colonies, France,
[Line 414]   Belgium, and the United States, and every other country where   protection to the first discoveries of an Invention is granted,   will of necessity be immediately obtained, and by the time these
[Line 415]   are perfected, which it is estimated will be in the month of   February, the Invention will be fit for Public Trial, but until the
[Line 416]   Patents are sealed any further disclosure would be most dangerous
[Line 417]   to the principle on which it is based.    Under these circumstances, it is proposed to raise an immediate   sum of £2,000 in furtherance of the Projector’s views, and as   some protection to the parties who may embark in the matter, that   this is not a visionary plan for objects imperfectly considered,   Mr Colombine, to whom the secret has been confided, has allowed   his name to be used on the occasion, and who will if referred
[Line 418]   to corroborate this statement, and convince any inquirer of the   reasonable prospects of large pecuniary results following the
[Line 419]   development of the Invention. 
[Line 420]   It is, therefore, intended to raise the sum of £2,000 in twenty
[Line 421]   sums of £100 each (of which any subscriber may take one or more not
[Line 422]   exceeding five in number to be held by any individual) the amount   of which is to be paid into the hands of Mr Colombine as General   Manager of the concern to be by him appropriated in procuring the   several Patents and providing the expenses incidental to the works
[Line 423]   in progress. For each of which sums of £100 it is intended and   agreed that twelve months after the 1st February next, the several   parties subscribing shall receive as an equivalent for the risk to
[Line 424]   be run the sum of £300 for each of the sums of £100 now subscribed,
[Line 425]   provided when the time arrives the Patents shall be found to answer   the purposes intended.
[Line 426]    As full and complete success is alone looked to, no moderate or   imperfect benefit is to be anticipated, but the work, if it once   passes the necessary ordeal, to which inventions of every kind
[Line 427]   must be first subject, will then be regarded by every one as the   most astonishing discovery of modern times; no half success can
[Line 428]   follow, and therefore the full nature of the risk is immediately   ascertained.
[Line 429]    The intention is to work and prove the Patent by collective instead   of individual aid as less hazardous at first and more advantageous   in the result for the Inventor, as well as others, by having the
[Line 430]   interest of several engaged in aiding one common object--the
[Line 431]   development of a Great Plan. The failure is not feared, yet as   perfect success might, by possibility, not ensue, it is necessary
[Line 432]   to provide for that result, and the parties concerned make it a   condition that no return of the subscribed money shall be required,   if the Patents shall by any unforeseen circumstances not be capable
[Line 433]   of being worked at all; against which, the first application of
[Line 434]   the money subscribed, that of securing the Patents, affords a
[Line 435]   reasonable security, as no one without solid grounds would think of   such an expenditure.
[Line 436]   It is perfectly needless to state that no risk or responsibility of   any kind can arise beyond the payment of the sum to be subscribed
[Line 437]   under any circumstances whatever.    As soon as the Patents shall be perfected and proved it is
[Line 438]   contemplated, so far as may be found practicable, to further the   great object in view a Company shall be formed but respecting which   it is unnecessary to state further details, than that a preference
[Line 439]   will be given to all those persons who now subscribe, and to whom
[Line 440]   shares shall be appropriated according to the larger amount (being
[Line 441]   three times the sum to be paid by each person) contemplated to
[Line 442]   be returned as soon as the success of the Invention shall have
[Line 443]   been established, at their option, or the money paid, whereby the
[Line 444]   Subscriber will have the means of either withdrawing with a large   pecuniary benefit, or by continuing his interest in the concern,
[Line 445]   lay the foundation for participating in the immense benefit which   must follow the success of the plan.
[Line 446]   It is not pretended to conceal that the project is a
[Line 447]   speculation--all parties believe that perfect success, and thence
[Line 448]   incalculable advantage of every kind, will follow to every   individual joining in this great undertaking; but the Gentlemen
[Line 449]   engaged in it wish that no concealment of the consequences, perfect   success, or possible failure, should in the slightest degree
[Line 450]   be inferred. They believe this will prove the germ of a mighty
[Line 451]   work, and in that belief call for the operation of others with no
[Line 452]   visionary object, but a legitimate one before them, to attain that   point where perfect success will be secured from their combined   exertions.
[Line 453]   All applications to be made to D. E. Colombine, Esquire, 8 Carlton
[Line 454]   Chambers, Regent Street. 
[Line 455] The applications did not materialise, as was only to be expected in
[Line 456] view of the vagueness of the proposals. Colombine did some advertising, and Mr Roebuck expressed himself as unwilling to proceed further in the
[Line 457] venture. Henson experimented with models to a certain extent, while
[Line 458] Stringfellow looked for funds for the construction of a full-sized monoplane. In November of 1843 he suggested that he and Henson should construct a large model out of their own funds. On Henson’s suggestion Colombine and Marriott were bought out as regards the original patent,
[Line 459] and Stringfellow and Henson entered into an agreement and set to work.
[Line 460]  Their work is briefly described in a little pamphlet by F. J.
[Line 461] Stringfellow, entitled _A few Remarks on what has been done with screw-propelled Aeroplane Machines from 1809 to 1892_. The author writes with regard to the work that his father and Henson undertook:--
[Line 462] ‘They commenced the construction of a small model operated by a spring,
[Line 463] and laid down the larger model 20 ft. from tip to tip of planes, 3½ ft.
[Line 464] wide, giving 70 ft. of sustaining surface, about 10 more in the tail.
[Line 465] The making of this model required great consideration; various supports for the wings were tried, so as to combine lightness with firmness, strength and rigidity.
[Line 466]  ‘The planes were staid from three sets of fish-shaped masts, and rigged square and firm by flat steel rigging. The engine and boiler were
[Line 467] put in the car to drive two screw-propellers, right and left-handed, 3 ft. in diameter, with four blades each, occupying three-quarters
[Line 468] of the area of the circumference, set at an angle of 60 degrees. A considerable time was spent in perfecting the motive power. Compressed
[Line 469] air was tried and abandoned. Tappets, cams, and eccentrics were all
[Line 470] tried, to work the slide valve, to obtain the best results. The piston rod of engine passed through both ends of the cylinder, and with long
[Line 471] connecting rods worked direct on the crank of the propellers. From memorandum of experiments still preserved the following is a copy of one: June, 27th, 1845, water 50 ozs., spirit 10 ozs., lamp lit 8.45, gauge moves 8.46, engine started 8.48 (100 lb. pressure), engine stopped 8.57, worked 9 minutes, 2,288 revolutions, average 254 per minute. No priming, 40 ozs. water consumed, propulsion (thrust of
[Line 472] propellers), 5 lbs. 4½ ozs. at commencement, steady, 4 lbs. ½ oz., 57 revolutions to 1 oz. water, steam cut off one-third from beginning.
[Line 473]  ‘The diameter of cylinder of engine was 1½ inch, length of stroke 3 inches.
[Line 474]  ‘In the meantime an engine was also made for the smaller model, and a wing action tried, but with poor results. The time was mostly devoted to the larger model, and in 1847 a tent was erected on Bala Down, about two miles from Chard, and the model taken up one night by the
[Line 475] workmen. The experiments were not so favourable as was expected. The machine could not support itself for any distance, but, when launched off, gradually descended, although the power and surface should have been ample; indeed, according to latest calculations, the thrust should have carried more than three times the weight, for there was a thrust
[Line 476] of 5 lbs. from the propellers, and a surface of over 70 square feet to sustain under 30 lbs., but necessary speed was lacking.’ 
[Line 477] [Illustration: Stringfellow’s model triplane, 1868.]
[Line 478]  Stringfellow himself explained the failure as follows:--
[Line 479] ‘There stood our aerial protégée in all her purity--too delicate, too fragile, too beautiful for this rough world; at least those were
[Line 480] my ideas at the time, but little did I think how soon it was to be realised. I soon found, before I had time to introduce the spark, a drooping in the wings, a flagging in all the parts. In less than ten
[Line 481] minutes the machine was saturated with wet from a deposit of dew, so that anything like a trial was impossible by night. I did not consider we could get the silk tight and rigid enough. Indeed, the framework
[Line 482] altogether was too weak. The steam-engine was the best part. Our
[Line 483] want of success was not for want of power or sustaining surface, but
[Line 484] for want of proper adaptation of the means to the end of the various parts.’
[Line 485]  Henson, who had spent a considerable amount of money in these
[Line 486] experimental constructions, consoled himself for failure by venturing
[Line 487] into matrimony; in 1849 he went to America, leaving Stringfellow to continue experimenting alone. From 1846 to 1848 Stringfellow worked on what is really an epoch-making item in the history of aeronautics--the
[Line 488] first engine-driven aeroplane which actually flew. The machine in question had a 10 foot span, and was 2 ft. across in the widest part of the wing; the length of tail was 3 ft. 6 ins., and the span of tail in the widest part 22 ins., the total sustaining area being about 14 sq. ft. The motive power consisted of an engine with a cylinder of
[Line 489] three-quarter inch diameter and a two-inch stroke; between this and the crank shaft was a bevelled gear giving three revolutions of the propellers to every stroke of the engine; the propellers, right and
[Line 490] left screw, were four-bladed and 16 inches in diameter. The total weight of the model with engine was 8 lbs. Its successful flight is ascribed to the fact that Stringfellow curved the wings, giving them rigid front edges and flexible trailing edges, as suggested long before both by Da Vinci and Borelli, but never before put into practice.  Mr F. J. Stringfellow, in the pamphlet quoted above, gives the best
[Line 491] account of the flight of this model: ‘My father had constructed another
[Line 492] small model which was finished early in 1848, and having the loan of
[Line 493] a long room in a disused lace factory, early in June the small model
[Line 494] was moved there for experiments. The room was about 22 yards long and
[Line 495] from 10 to 12 ft. high.... The inclined wire for starting the machine
[Line 496] occupied less than half the length of the room and left space at the end for the machine to clear the floor. In the first experiment the tail was set at too high an angle, and the machine rose too rapidly on
[Line 497] leaving the wire. After going a few yards it slid back as if coming
[Line 498] down an inclined plane, at such an angle that the point of the tail
[Line 499] struck the ground and was broken. The tail was repaired and set at a smaller angle. The steam was again got up, and the machine started down the wire, and, upon reaching the point of self-detachment, it gradually rose until it reached the farther end of the room, striking a hole in the canvas placed to stop it. In experiments the machine flew
[Line 500] well, when rising as much as one in seven. The late Rev. J. Riste,
[Line 501] Esq., lace manufacturer, Northcote Spicer, Esq., J. Toms, Esq., and
[Line 502] others witnessed experiments. Mr Marriatt, late of the San Francisco
[Line 503] _News Letter_ brought down from London Mr Ellis, the then lessee of
[Line 504] Cremorne Gardens, Mr Partridge, and Lieutenant Gale, the aeronaut, to
[Line 505] witness experiments. Mr Ellis offered to construct a covered way at Cremorne for experiments. Mr Stringfellow repaired to Cremorne, but not
[Line 506] much better accommodations than he had at home were provided, owing
[Line 507] to unfulfilled engagement as to room. Mr Stringfellow was preparing for departure when a party of gentlemen unconnected with the Gardens begged to see an experiment, and finding them able to appreciate his endeavours, he got up steam and started the model down the wire. When it arrived at the spot where it should leave the wire it appeared to meet with some obstruction, and threatened to come to the ground, but it soon recovered itself and darted off in as fair a flight as it was possible to make at a distance of about 40 yards, where it was stopped by the canvas. 
[Line 508] ‘Having now demonstrated the practicability of making a steam-engine
[Line 509] fly, and finding nothing but a pecuniary loss and little honour, this experimenter rested for a long time, satisfied with what he had
[Line 510] effected. The subject, however, had to him special charms, and he still contemplated the renewal of his experiments.’  It appears that Stringfellow’s interest did not revive sufficiently for the continuance of the experiments until the founding of the
[Line 511] Aeronautical Society of Great Britain in 1866. Wenham’s paper on Aerial
[Line 512] Locomotion read at the first meeting of the Society, which was held at the Society of Arts under the Presidency of the Duke of Argyll, was the means of bringing Stringfellow back into the field. It was
[Line 513] Wenham’s suggestion, in the first place, that monoplane design should
[Line 514] be abandoned for the superposition of planes; acting on this suggestion Stringfellow constructed a model triplane, and also designed a steam
[Line 515] engine of slightly over one horse-power, and a one horse-power copper
[Line 516] boiler and fire box which, although capable of sustaining a pressure of
[Line 517] 500 lbs. to the square inch, weighed only about 40 lbs.
[Line 518]  Both the engine and the triplane model were exhibited at the first Aeronautical Exhibition held at the Crystal Palace in 1868. The triplane had a supporting surface of 28 sq. ft.; inclusive of engine,
[Line 519] boiler, fuel, and water its total weight was under 12 lbs. The engine worked two 21 in. propellers at 600 revolutions per minute, and developed 100 lbs. steam pressure in five minutes, yielding one-third horse-power. Since no free flight was allowed in the Exhibition, owing
[Line 520] to danger from fire, the triplane was suspended from a wire in the nave of the building, and it was noted that, when running along the
[Line 521] wire, the model made a perceptible lift. 
[Line 522] A prize of £100 was awarded to the steam engine as the lightest steam
[Line 523] engine in proportion to its power. The engine and model together may be reckoned as Stringfellow’s best achievement. He used his £100 in
[Line 524] preparation for further experiments, but he was now an old man, and his work was practically done. Both the triplane and the engine were
[Line 525] eventually bought for the Washington Museum; Stringfellow’s earlier models, together with those constructed by him in conjunction with
[Line 526] Henson, remain in this country in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
[Line 527]  John Stringfellow died on December 13th, 1883. His place in the history
[Line 528] of aeronautics is at least equal to that of Cayley, and it may be said that he laid the foundation of such work as was subsequently accomplished by Maxim, Langley, and their fellows. It was the coming of the internal combustion engine that rendered flight practicable,
[Line 529] and had this prime mover been available in John Stringfellow’s day the Wright brothers’ achievement might have been antedated by half a
[Line 530] century.
[Line 531]  
[Line 532]  V
[Line 533] WENHAM, LE BRIS, AND SOME OTHERS   There are few outstanding events in the development of aeronautics
[Line 534] between Stringfellow’s final achievement and the work of such men as
[Line 535] Lilienthal, Pilcher, Montgomery, and their kind; in spite of this, the later middle decades of the nineteenth century witnessed a considerable
[Line 536] amount of spade work both in England and in France, the two countries
[Line 537] which led in the way in aeronautical development until Lilienthal gave honour to Germany, and Langley and Montgomery paved the way for the Wright Brothers in America.
[Line 538]  Two abortive attempts characterised the sixties of last century in
[Line 539] France. As regards the first of these, it was carried out by three
[Line 540] men, Nadar, Ponton d’Amecourt, and De la Landelle, who conceived the idea of a full-sized helicopter machine. D’Amecourt exhibited a steam model, constructed in 1865, at the Aeronautical Society’s Exhibition in 1868. The engine was aluminium with cylinders of bronze, driving two
[Line 541] screws placed one above the other and rotating in opposite directions, but the power was not sufficient to lift the model. De la Landelle’s principal achievement consisted in the publication in 1863 of a book
[Line 542] entitled _Aviation_, which has a certain historical value; he got out several designs for large machines on the helicopter principle, but did little more until the three combined in the attempt to raise funds for the construction of their full-sized machine. Since the funds were not forthcoming, Nadar took to ballooning as the means of raising
[Line 543] money; apparently he found this substitute for real flight sufficiently
[Line 544] interesting to divert him from the study of the helicopter principle, for the experiment went no further.  The other experimenter of this period, one Count d’Esterno, took out a patent in 1864 for a soaring machine which allowed for alteration of the angle of incidence of the wings in the manner that was subsequently
[Line 545] carried out by the Wright Brothers. It was not until 1883 that any
[Line 546] attempt was made to put this patent to practical use, and, as the
[Line 547] inventor died while it was under construction, it was never completed. D’Esterno was also responsible for the production of a work entitled
[Line 548] _Du Vol des Oiseaux_, which is a very remarkable study of the flight of
[Line 549] birds. 
[Line 550] Mention has already been made of the founding of the Aeronautical
[Line 551] Society of Great Britain, which, since 1918, has been the Royal Aeronautical Society. 1866 witnessed the first meeting of the Society under the Presidency of the Duke of Argyll, when in June, at the
[Line 552] Society of Arts, Francis Herbert Wenham read his now classic paper _Aerial Locomotion_. Certain quotations from this will show how clearly Wenham had thought out the problems connected with flight. 
[Line 553] ‘The first subject for consideration is the proportion of surface
[Line 554] to weight, and their combined effect in descending perpendicularly
[Line 555] through the atmosphere. The datum is here based upon the consideration
[Line 556] of safety, for it may sometimes be needful for a living being to drop
[Line 557] passively, without muscular effort. One square foot of sustaining surface for every pound of the total weight will be sufficient for
[Line 558] security.
[Line 559]  ‘According to Smeaton’s table of atmospheric resistances, to produce
[Line 560] a force of one pound on a square foot, the wind must move against the plane (or which is the same thing, the plane against the wind), at the rate of twenty-two feet per second, or 1,320 feet per minute, equal to
[Line 561] fifteen miles per hour. The resistance of the air will now balance the
[Line 562] weight on the descending surface, and, consequently, it cannot exceed that speed. Now, twenty-two feet per second is the velocity acquired at
[Line 563] the end of a fall of eight feet--a height from which a well-knit man or
[Line 564] animal may leap down without much risk of injury. Therefore, if a man
[Line 565] with parachute weigh together 143 lbs., spreading the same number of
[Line 566] square feet of surface contained in a circle fourteen and a half feet in diameter, he will descend at perhaps an unpleasant velocity, but with safety to life and limb.  ‘It is a remarkable fact how this proportion of wing-surface to
[Line 567] weight extends throughout a great variety of the flying portion of the animal kingdom, even down to hornets, bees, and other insects.
[Line 568] In some instances, however, as in the gallinaceous tribe, including
[Line 569] pheasants, this area is somewhat exceeded, but they are known to be very poor fliers. Residing as they do chiefly on the ground, their
[Line 570] wings are only required for short distances, or for raising them or
[Line 571] easing their descent from their roosting-places in forest trees, the shortness of their wings preventing them from taking extended flights.
[Line 572] The wing-surface of the common swallow is rather more than in the ratio of two square feet per pound, but having also great length of pinion,
[Line 573] it is both swift and enduring in its flight. When on a rapid course this bird is in the habit of furling its wings into a narrow compass.
[Line 574] The greater extent of surface is probably needful for the continual
[Line 575] variations of speed and instant stoppages for obtaining its insect food.  ‘On the other hand, there are some birds, particularly of the duck
[Line 576] tribe, whose wing-surface but little exceeds half a square foot, or seventy-two inches per pound, yet they may be classed among the strongest and swiftest of fliers. A weight of one pound, suspended from an area of this extent, would acquire a velocity due to a fall of
[Line 577] sixteen feet--a height sufficient for the destruction or injury of most
[Line 578] animals. But when the plane is urged forward horizontally, in a manner analogous to the wings of a bird during flight, the sustaining power is
[Line 579] greatly influenced by the form and arrangement of the surface.  ‘In the case of perpendicular descent, as a parachute, the sustaining effect will be much the same, whatever the figure of the outline of the superficies may be, and a circle perhaps affords the best resistance of
[Line 580] any. Take, for example, a circle of twenty square feet (as possessed by the pelican) loaded with as many pounds. This, as just stated, will limit the rate of perpendicular descent to 1,320 feet per minute.
[Line 581] But instead of a circle sixty-one inches in diameter, if the area is
[Line 582] bounded by a parallelogram ten feet long by two feet broad, and whilst
[Line 583] at perfect freedom to descend perpendicularly, let a force be applied exactly in a horizontal direction, so as to carry it edgeways, with the
[Line 584] long side foremost, at a forward speed of thirty miles per hour--just double that of its passive descent: the rate of fall under these
[Line 585] conditions will be decreased most remarkably, probably to less than one-fifteenth part, or eighty-eight feet per minute, or one mile per
[Line 586] hour.’  And again: ‘It has before been shown how utterly inadequate the mere perpendicular impulse of a plane is found to be in supporting a weight, when there is no horizontal motion at the time. There is no material
[Line 587] weight of air to be acted upon, and it yields to the slightest force, however great the velocity of impulse may be. On the other hand, suppose that a large bird, in full flight, can make forty miles per hour, or 3,520 feet per minute, and performs one stroke per second. Now, during every fractional portion of that stroke, the wing is acting upon and obtaining an impulse from a fresh and undisturbed body
[Line 588] of air; and if the vibration of the wing is limited to an arc of two
[Line 589] feet, this by no means represents the small force of action that would be obtained when in a stationary position, for the impulse is secured
[Line 590] upon a stratum of fifty-eight feet in length of air at each stroke. So that the conditions of weight of air for obtaining support equally well apply to weight of air and its reaction in producing forward impulse.
[Line 591]  ‘So necessary is the acquirement of this horizontal speed, even in commencing flight, that most heavy birds, when possible, rise against
[Line 592] the wind, and even run at the top of their speed to make their
[Line 593] wings available, as in the example of the eagle, mentioned at the
[Line 594] commencement of this paper. It is stated that the Arabs, on horseback, can approach near enough to spear these birds, when on the plain,
[Line 595] before they are able to rise; their habit is to perch on an eminence, where possible. 
[Line 596] ‘The tail of a bird is not necessary for flight. A pigeon can fly
[Line 597] perfectly with this appendage cut short off; it probably performs an
[Line 598] important function in steering, for it is to be remarked, that most birds that have either to pursue or evade pursuit are amply provided with this organ.
[Line 599] ‘The foregoing reasoning is based upon facts, which tend to show
[Line 600] that the flight of the largest and heaviest of all birds is really
[Line 601] performed with but a small amount of force, and that man is endowed with sufficient muscular power to enable him also to take individual
[Line 602] and extended flights, and that success is probably only involved in a question of suitable mechanical adaptations. But if the wings are
[Line 603] to be modelled in imitation of natural examples, but very little consideration will serve to demonstrate its utter impracticability when
[Line 604] applied in these forms.’ 
[Line 605] Thus Wenham, one of the best theorists of his age. The Society with
[Line 606] which this paper connects his name has done work, between that time
[Line 607] and the present, of which the importance cannot be overestimated, and has been of the greatest value in the development of aeronautics,
[Line 608] both in theory and experiment. The objects of the Society are to give
[Line 609] a stronger impulse to the scientific study of aerial navigation, to promote the intercourse of those interested in the subject at home
[Line 610] and abroad, and to give advice and instruction to those who study the principles upon which aeronautical science is based. From the date of its foundation the Society has given special study to dynamic flight,
[Line 611] putting this before ballooning. Its library, its bureau of advice and information, and its meetings, all assist in forwarding the study of aeronautics, and its twenty-three early _Annual Reports_ are of considerable value, containing as they do a large amount of useful
[Line 612] information on aeronautical subjects, and forming practically the basis
[Line 613] of aeronautical science.
[Line 614] Ante to Wenham, Stringfellow and the French experimenters already
[Line 615] noted, by some years, was Le Bris, a French sea captain, who appears to have required only a thorough scientific training to have rendered him of equal moment in the history of gliding flight with Lilienthal himself. Le Bris, it appears, watched the albatross and deduced, from
[Line 616] the manner in which it supported itself in the air, that plane surfaces
[Line 617] could be constructed and arranged to support a man in like manner. Octave Chanute, himself a leading exponent of gliding, gives the best
[Line 618] description of Le Bris’s experiments in a work, _Progress in Flying Machines_, which, although published as recently as 1894, is already
[Line 619] rare. Chanute draws from a still rarer book, namely, De la Landelle’s work published in 1884. Le Bris himself, quoted by De la Landelle as speaking of his first visioning of human flight, describes how he
[Line 620] killed an albatross, and then--‘I took the wing of the albatross and
[Line 621] exposed it to the breeze; and lo! in spite of me it drew forward into the wind; notwithstanding my resistance it tended to rise. Thus I had
[Line 622] discovered the secret of the bird! I comprehended the whole mystery of flight.’
[Line 623]  This apparently took place while at sea; later on Le Bris, returning to France, designed and constructed an artificial albatross of sufficient
[Line 624] size to bear his own weight. The fact that he followed the bird outline as closely as he did attests his lack of scientific training for his
[Line 625] task, while at the same time the success of the experiment was proof of his genius. The body of his artificial bird, boat-shaped, was 13½ ft. in length, with a breadth of 4 ft. at the widest part. The material
[Line 626] was cloth stretched over a wooden framework; in front was a small mast rigged after the manner of a ship’s masts to which were attached poles
[Line 627] and cords with which Le Bris intended to work the wings. Each wing was 23 ft. in length, giving a total supporting surface of nearly 220
[Line 628] sq. ft.; the weight of the whole apparatus was only 92 pounds. For
[Line 629] steering, both vertical and horizontal, a hinged tail was provided,
[Line 630] and the leading edge of each wing was made flexible. In construction
[Line 631] throughout, and especially in that of the wings, Le Bris adhered as closely as possible to the original albatross. 
[Line 632] He designed an ingenious kind of mechanism which he termed ‘Rotules,’ which by means of two levers gave a rotary motion to the front edge
[Line 633] of the wings, and also permitted of their adjustment to various angles. The inventor’s idea was to stand upright in the body of the
[Line 634] contrivance, working the levers and cords with his hands, and with his
[Line 635] feet on a pedal by means of which the steering tail was to be worked. He anticipated that, given a strong wind, he could rise into the air
[Line 636] after the manner of an albatross, without any need for flapping his
[Line 637] wings, and the account of his first experiment forms one of the most interesting incidents in the history of flight. It is related in full
[Line 638] in Chanute’s work, from which the present account is summarised.
[Line 639]  Le Bris made his first experiment on a main road near Douarnenez, at Trefeuntec. From his observation of the albatross Le Bris concluded that it was necessary to get some initial velocity in order to make the
[Line 640] machine rise; consequently on a Sunday morning, with a breeze of about 12 miles an hour blowing down the road, he had his albatross placed on a cart and set off, with a peasant driver, against the wind. At the
[Line 641] outset the machine was fastened to the cart by a rope running through
[Line 642] the rails on which the machine rested, and secured by a slip knot on
[Line 643] Le Bris’s own wrist, so that only a jerk on his part was necessary to loosen the rope and set the machine free. On each side walked an assistant holding the wings, and when a turn of the road brought the machine full into the wind these men were instructed to let go, while
[Line 644] the driver increased the pace from a walk to a trot. Le Bris, by pressure on the levers of the machine, raised the front edges of his
[Line 645] wings slightly; they took the wind almost instantly to such an extent
[Line 646] that the horse, relieved of a great part of the weight he had been drawing, turned his trot into a gallop. Le Bris gave the jerk of the
[Line 647] rope that should have unfastened the slip knot, but a concealed nail
[Line 648] on the cart caught the rope, so that it failed to run. The lift of the machine was such, however, that it relieved the horse of very nearly the weight of the cart and driver, as well as that of Le Bris and his
[Line 649] machine, and in the end the rails of the cart gave way. Le Bris rose in
[Line 650] the air, the machine maintaining perfect balance and rising to a height of nearly 300 ft., the total length of the glide being upwards of an
[Line 651] eighth of a mile. But at the last moment the rope which had originally fastened the machine to the cart got wound round the driver’s body, so that this unfortunate dangled in the air under Le Bris and probably assisted in maintaining the balance of the artificial albatross. Le Bris, congratulating himself on his success, was prepared to enjoy just
[Line 652] as long a time in the air as the pressure of the wind would permit, but the howls of the unfortunate driver at the end of the rope beneath
[Line 653] him dispelled his dreams; by working his levers he altered the angle of the front wing edges so skilfully as to make a very successful landing
[Line 654] indeed for the driver, who, entirely uninjured, disentangled himself
[Line 655] from the rope as soon as he touched the ground, and ran off to retrieve
[Line 656] his horse and cart. 
[Line 657] Apparently his release made a difference in the centre of gravity, for Le Bris could not manipulate his levers for further ascent; by skilful manipulation he retarded the descent sufficiently to escape injury to himself; the machine descended at an angle, so that one wing, striking
[Line 658] the ground in front of the other, received a certain amount of damage.
[Line 659]  It may have been on account of the reluctance of this same or another
[Line 660] driver that Le Bris chose a different method of launching himself in
[Line 661] making a second experiment with his albatross. He chose the edge of a
[Line 662] quarry which had been excavated in a depression of the ground; here
[Line 663] he assembled his apparatus at the bottom of the quarry, and by means
[Line 664] of a rope was hoisted to a height of nearly 100 ft. from the quarry bottom, this rope being attached to a mast which he had erected upon
[Line 665] the edge of the depression in which the quarry was situated. Thus
[Line 666] hoisted, the albatross was swung to face a strong breeze that blew
[Line 667] inland, and Le Bris manipulated his levers to give the front edges of his wings a downward angle, so that only the top surfaces should take the wing pressure. Having got his balance, he obtained a lifting angle
[Line 668] of incidence on the wings by means of his levers, and released the hook that secured the machine, gliding off over the quarry. On the glide
[Line 669] he met with the inevitable upward current of air that the quarry and
[Line 670] the depression in which it was situated caused; this current upset the balance of the machine and flung it to the bottom of the quarry,
[Line 671] breaking it to fragments. Le Bris, apparently as intrepid as ingenious,
[Line 672] gripped the mast from which his levers were worked, and, springing upward as the machine touched earth, escaped with no more damage than
[Line 673] a broken leg. But for the rebound of the levers he would have escaped even this. 
[Line 674] The interest of these experiments is enhanced by the fact that Le Bris was a seafaring man who conducted them from love of the science
[Line 675] which had fired his imagination, and in so doing exhausted his own small means. It was in 1855 that he made these initial attempts, and twelve years passed before his persistence was rewarded by a public
[Line 676] subscription made at Brest for the purpose of enabling him to continue
[Line 677] his experiments. He built a second albatross, and on the advice of his
[Line 678] friends ballasted it for flight instead of travelling in it himself. It was not so successful as the first, probably owing to the lack of
[Line 679] human control while in flight; on one of the trials a height of 150 ft. was attained, the glider being secured by a thin rope and held so as
[Line 680] to face into the wind. A glide of nearly an eighth of a mile was made
[Line 681] with the rope hanging slack, and, at the end of this distance, a rise
[Line 682] in the ground modified the force of the wind, whereupon the machine
[Line 683] settled down without damage. A further trial in a gusty wind resulted
[Line 684] in the complete destruction of this second machine; Le Bris had no more funds, no further subscriptions were likely to materialise, and so the experiments of this first exponent of the art of gliding (save
[Line 685] for Besnier and his kind) came to an end. They constituted a notable
[Line 686] achievement, and undoubtedly Le Bris deserves a better place than has
[Line 687] been accorded him in the ranks of the early experimenters.  Contemporary with him was Charles Spencer, the first man to practise gliding in England. His apparatus consisted of a pair of wings with a total area of 30 sq. ft., to which a tail and body were attached. The weight of this apparatus was some 24 lbs., and, launching himself on it from a small eminence, as was done later by Lilienthal in his experiments, the inventor made flights of over 120 feet. The glider in question was exhibited at the Aeronautical Exhibition of 1868. 
[Line 688] VI
[Line 689] THE AGE OF THE GIANTS   Until the Wright Brothers definitely solved the problem of flight and virtually gave the aeroplane its present place in aeronautics, there were three definite schools of experiment. The first of these was that which sought to imitate nature by means of the ornithopter or flapping-wing machines directly imitative of bird flight; the second
[Line 690] school was that which believed in the helicopter or lifting screw; the
[Line 691] third and eventually successful school is that which followed up the principle enunciated by Cayley, that of opposing a plane surface to the resistance of the air by supplying suitable motive power to drive it at
[Line 692] the requisite angle for support.
[Line 693] Engineering problems generally go to prove that too close an imitation of nature in her forms of reciprocating motion is not advantageous; it is impossible to copy the minutiae of a bird’s wing effectively,
[Line 694] and the bird in flight depends on the tiniest details of its feathers just as much as on the general principle on which the whole wing is
[Line 695] constructed. Bird flight, however, has attracted many experimenters,
[Line 696] including even Lilienthal; among others may be mentioned F. W. Brearey,
[Line 697] who invented what he called the ‘Pectoral cord,’ which stored energy
[Line 698] on each upstroke of the artificial wing; E. P. Frost; Major R. Moore, and especially Hureau de Villeneuve, a most enthusiastic student
[Line 699] of this form of flight, who began his experiments about 1865, and altogether designed and made nearly 300 artificial birds. One of his later constructions was a machine in bird form with a wing span of about 50 ft.; the motive power for this was supplied by steam from a boiler which, being stationary on the ground, was connected by a length
[Line 700] of hose to the machine. De Villeneuve, turning on steam for his first trial, obtained sufficient power to make the wings beat very forcibly; with the inventor on the machine the latter rose several feet into the
[Line 701] air, whereupon de Villeneuve grew nervous and turned off the steam
[Line 702] supply. The machine fell to the earth, breaking one of its wings, and it does not appear that de Villeneuve troubled to reconstruct it. This experiment remains as the greatest success yet achieved by any machine constructed on the ornithopter principle.
[Line 703] It may be that, as forecasted by the prophet Wells, the flapping-wing machine will yet come to its own and compete with the aeroplane in
[Line 704] efficiency. Against this, however, are the practical advantages of the rotary mechanism of the aeroplane propeller as compared with the movement of a bird’s wing, which, according to Marey, moves in a figure of eight. The force derived from a propeller is of necessity continual, while it is equally obvious that that derived from a flapping movement is intermittent, and, in the recovery of a wing after completion of one
[Line 705] stroke for the next, there is necessarily a certain cessation, if not loss, of power.
[Line 706] The matter of experiment along any lines in connection with aviation is primarily one of hard cash. Throughout the whole history of flight up to the outbreak of the European war development has been handicapped
[Line 707] on the score of finance, and, since the arrival of the aeroplane,
[Line 708] both ornithopter and helicopter schools have been handicapped by
[Line 709] this consideration. Thus serious study of the efficiency of wings in
[Line 710] imitation of those of the living bird has not been carried to a point
[Line 711] that might win success for this method of propulsion. Even Wilbur Wright studied this subject and propounded certain theories, while
[Line 712] a later and possibly more scientific student, F. W. Lanchester, has
[Line 713] also contributed empirical conclusions. Another and earlier student was Lawrence Hargrave, who made a wing-propelled model which achieved successful flight, and in 1885 was exhibited before the Royal Society
[Line 714] of New South Wales. Hargrave called the principle on which his propeller worked that of a ‘Trochoided plane’; it was, in effect, similar to the feathering of an oar. 
[Line 715] Hargrave, to diverge for a brief while from the machine to the man,
[Line 716] was one who, although he achieved nothing worthy of special remark, contributed a great deal of painstaking work to the science of flight.
[Line 717] He made a series of experiments with man-lifting kites in addition to
[Line 718] making a study of flapping-wing flight. It cannot be said that he set forth any new principle; his work was mainly imitative, but at the same time by developing ideas originated in great measure by others he
[Line 719] helped toward the solution of the problem.  Attempts at flight on the helicopter principle consist in the work of De la Landelle and others already mentioned. The possibility of flight by this method is modified by a very definite disadvantage of which
[Line 720] lovers of the helicopter seem to take little account. It is always
[Line 721] claimed for a machine of this type that it possesses great advantages both in rising and in landing, since, if it were effective, it would obviously be able to rise from and alight on any ground capable of
[Line 722] containing its own bulk; a further advantage claimed is that the helicopter would be able to remain stationary in the air, maintaining itself in any position by the vertical lift of its propeller.
[Line 723]  These potential assets do not take into consideration the fact that
[Line 724] efficiency is required not only in rising, landing, and remaining stationary in the air, but also in actual flight. It must be evident that if a certain amount of the motive force is used in maintaining the machine off the ground, that amount of force is missing from the total
[Line 725] of horizontal driving power. Again, it is often assumed by advocates
[Line 726] of this form of flight that the rapidity of climb of the helicopter would be far greater than that of the driven plane; this view overlooks the fact that the maintenance of aerodynamic support would claim the
[Line 727] greater part of the engine-power; the rate of ascent would be governed
[Line 728] by the amount of power that could be developed surplus to that required
[Line 729] for maintenance.  This is best explained by actual figures: assuming that a propeller 15
[Line 730] ft. in diameter is used, almost 50 horse-power would be required to get
[Line 731] an upward lift of 1,000 pounds; this amount of horse-power would be
[Line 732] continually absorbed in maintaining the machine in the air at any given level; for actual lift from one level to another at a speed of eleven feet per second a further 20 horse-power would be required, which means that 70 horse-power must be constantly provided for; this absorption of power in the mere maintenance of aerodynamic support is a permanent drawback.
[Line 733]  The attraction of the helicopter lies, probably, in the ease with which flight is demonstrated by means of models constructed on this principle, but one truism with regard to the principles of flight is that the problems change remarkably, and often unexpectedly, with the size of the machine constructed for experiment. Berriman, in a brief but very interesting manual entitled _Principles of
[Line 734] Flight_, assumed that ‘there is a significant dimension of which
[Line 735] the effective area is an expression of the second power, while the weight became an expression of the third power. Then once again we have the two-thirds power law militating against the successful construction of large helicopters, on the ground that the essential
[Line 736] weight increases disproportionately fast to the effective area. From a
[Line 737] consideration of the structural features of propellers it is evident
[Line 738] that this particular relationship does not apply in practice, but it seems reasonable that some such governing factor should exist as an
[Line 739] explanation of the apparent failure of all full-sized machines that
[Line 740] have been constructed. Among models there is nothing more strikingly successful than the toy helicopter, in which the essential weight is so small compared with the effective area.’ 
[Line 741] De la Landelle’s work, already mentioned, was carried on a few years later by another Frenchman, Castel, who constructed a machine with
[Line 742] eight propellers arranged in two fours and driven by a compressed air motor or engine. The model with which Castel experimented had a
[Line 743] total weight of only 49 lbs.; it rose in the air and smashed itself by driving against a wall, and the inventor does not seem to have
[Line 744] proceeded further. Contemporary with Castel was Professor Forlanini, whose design was for a machine very similar to de la Landelle’s, with two superposed screws. This machine ranks as the second on the
[Line 745] helicopter principle to achieve flight; it remained in the air for no
[Line 746] less than the third of a minute in one of its trials. 
[Line 747] Later experimenters in this direction were Kress, a German; Professor Wellner, an Austrian; and W. R. Kimball, an American. Kress, like most Germans, set to the development of an idea which others had originated;
[Line 748] he followed de la Landelle and Forlanini by fitting two superposed
[Line 749] propellers revolving in opposite directions, and with this machine he
[Line 750] achieved good results as regards horse-power to weight; Kimball, it appears, did not get beyond the rubber-driven model stage, and any success he may have achieved was modified by the theory enunciated by Berriman and quoted above. 
[Line 751] Comparing these two schools of thought, the helicopter and bird-flight schools, it appears that the latter has the greater chance of eventual success--that is, if either should ever come into competition with the
[Line 752] aeroplane as effective means of flight. So far, the aeroplane holds the field, but the whole science of flight is so new and so full of
[Line 753] unexpected developments that this is no reason for assuming that other
[Line 754] means may not give equal effect, when money and brains are diverted
[Line 755] from the driven plane to a closer imitation of natural flight.  Reverting from non-success to success, from consideration of the two
[Line 756] methods mentioned above to the direction in which practical flight has been achieved, it is to be noted that between the time of Le Bris, Stringfellow, and their contemporaries, and the nineties of last century, there was much plodding work carried out with little visible result, more especially so far as English students were concerned. Among the incidents of those years is one of the most
[Line 757] pathetic tragedies in the whole history of aviation, that of Alphonse
[Line 758] Penaud, who, in his thirty years of life, condensed the experience of his predecessors and combined it with his own genius to state in a published patent what the aeroplane of to-day should be. Consider the following abstract of Penaud’s design as published in his patent of 1876, and comparison of this with the aeroplane that now exists will show very few divergences except for those forced on the inventor by the fact that the internal combustion engine had not then developed.
[Line 759] The double-surfaced planes were to be built with wooden ribs and arranged with a slight dihedral angle; there was to be a large aspect
[Line 760] ratio and the wings were cambered as in Stringfellow’s later models.
[Line 761] Provision was made for warping the wings while in flight, and the trailing edges were so designed as to be capable of upward twist while
[Line 762] the machine was in the air. The planes were to be placed above the car, and provision was even made for a glass wind-screen to give protection
[Line 763] to the pilot during flight. Steering was to be accomplished by means
[Line 764] of lateral and vertical planes forming a tail; these controlled by a
[Line 765] single lever corresponding to the ‘joy stick’ of the present day plane.
[Line 766] Penaud conceived this machine as driven by two propellers;
[Line 767] alternatively these could be driven by petrol or steam-fed motor,
[Line 768] and the centre of gravity of the machine while in flight was in the
[Line 769] front fifth of the wings. Penaud estimated from 20 to 30 horse-power sufficient to drive this machine, weighing with pilot and passenger 2,600 lbs., through the air at a speed of 60 miles an hour, with the wings set at an angle of incidence of two degrees. So complete was the design that it even included instruments, consisting of an aneroid,
[Line 770] pressure indicator, an anemometer, a compass, and a level. There,
[Line 771] with few alterations, is the aeroplane as we know it--and Penaud was twenty-seven when his patent was published.
[Line 772] For three years longer he worked, experimenting with models,
[Line 773] contributing essays and other valuable data to French papers on the
[Line 774] subject of aeronautics. His gains were ill health, poverty, and neglect, and at the age of thirty a pistol shot put an end to what had promised to be one of the most brilliant careers in all the history of flight.
[Line 775] Two years before the publication of Penaud’s patent Thomas Moy experimented at the Crystal Palace with a twin-propelled aeroplane,
[Line 776] steam driven, which seems to have failed mainly because the internal combustion engine had not yet come to give sufficient power for weight. Moy anchored his machine to a pole running on a prepared
[Line 777] circular track; his engine weighed 80 lbs. and, developing only three horse-power, gave him a speed of 12 miles an hour. He himself estimated that the machine would not rise until he could get a speed of 35 miles
[Line 778] an hour, and his estimate was correct. Two six-bladed propellers were placed side by side between the two main planes of the machine, which was supported on a triangular wheeled undercarriage and steered by fairly conventional tail planes. Moy realised that he could not get
[Line 779] sufficient power to achieve flight, but he went on experimenting in various directions, and left much data concerning his experiments which has not yet been deemed worthy of publication, but which still contains
[Line 780] a mass of information that is of practical utility, embodying as it
[Line 781] does a vast amount of painstaking work.
[Line 782]  Penaud and Moy were followed by Goupil, a Frenchman, who, in place of
[Line 783] attempting to fit a motor to an aeroplane, experimented by making the wind his motor. He anchored his machine to the ground, allowing it two feet of lift, and merely waited for a wind to come along and lift it.
[Line 784] The machine was stream lined, and the wings, curving as in the early German patterns of war aeroplanes, gave a total lifting surface of about 290 sq. ft. Anchored to the ground and facing a wind of 19 feet
[Line 785] per second, Goupil’s machine lifted its own weight and that of two men
[Line 786] as well to the limit of its anchorage. Although this took place as late as 1883 the inventor went no further in practical work. He published
[Line 787] a book, however, entitled _La Locomotion Aérienne_, which is still of
[Line 788] great importance, more especially on the subject of inherent stability.
[Line 789]  In 1884 came the first patents of Horatio Phillips, whose work lay
[Line 790] mainly in the direction of investigation into the curvature of plane
[Line 791] surfaces, with a view to obtaining the greatest amount of support.
[Line 792] Phillips was one of the first to treat the problem of curvature of
[Line 793] planes as a matter for scientific experiment, and, great as has been the development of the driven plane in the 36 years that have passed
[Line 794] since he began, there is still room for investigation into the subject which he studied so persistently and with such valuable result.
[Line 795]  At this point it may be noted that, with the solitary exception of
[Line 796] Le Bris, practically every student of flight had so far set about
[Line 797] constructing the means of launching humanity into the air without any attempt at ascertaining the nature and peculiarities of the sustaining medium. The attitude of experimenters in general might be compared to
[Line 798] that of a man who from boyhood had grown up away from open water, and, at the first sight of an expanse of water, set to work to construct a boat with a vague idea that, since wood would float, only sufficient
[Line 799] power was required to make him an efficient navigator. Accident, perhaps, in the shape of lack of means of procuring driving power, drove Le Bris to the form of experiment which he actually carried out; it remained for the later years of the nineteenth century to produce
[Line 800] men who were content to ascertain the nature of the support the air would afford before attempting to drive themselves through it.
[Line 801]  Of the age in which these men lived and worked, giving their all in many cases to the science they loved, even to life itself, it may be said with truth that ‘there were giants on the earth in those days,’ as far as aeronautics is in question. It was an age of giants who lived and dared and died, venturing into uncharted space, knowing nothing
[Line 802] of its dangers, giving, as a man gives to his mistress, without stint
[Line 803] and for the joy of the giving. The science of to-day, compared with the glimmerings that were in that age of the giants, is a fixed and certain thing; the problems of to-day are minor problems, for the great
[Line 804] major problem vanished in solution when the Wright Brothers made their first ascent. In that age of the giants was evolved the flying man,
[Line 805] the new type in human species which found full expression and came to
[Line 806] full development in the days of the war, achieving feats of daring and
[Line 807] endurance which leave the commonplace landsman staggered at thought of that of which his fellows prove themselves capable. He is a new type, this flying man, a being of self-forgetfulness; of such was Lilienthal,
[Line 808] of such was Pilcher; of such in later days were Farman, Bleriot, Hamel, Rolls, and their fellows; great names that will live for as long as
[Line 809] man flies, adventurers equally with those of the spacious days of Elizabeth. To each of these came the call, and he worked and dared and
[Line 810] passed, having, perhaps, advanced one little step in the long march
[Line 811] that has led toward the perfecting of flight.
[Line 812]  It is not yet twenty years since man first flew, but into that twenty
[Line 813] years have been compressed a century or so of progress, while, in the two decades that preceded it, was compressed still more. We have only to recall and recount the work of four men: Lilienthal, Langley,
[Line 814] Pilcher, and Clement Ader to see the immense stride that was made between the time when Penaud pulled a trigger for the last time and the Wright Brothers first left the earth. Into those two decades was compressed the investigation that meant knowledge of the qualities of
[Line 815] the air, together with the development of the one prime mover that rendered flight a possibility--the internal combustion engine. The
[Line 816] coming and progress of this latter is a thing apart, to be detailed separately; for the present we are concerned with the evolution of the driven plane, and with it the evolution of that daring being, the flying man. The two are inseparable, for the men gave themselves to their art; the story of Lilienthal’s life and death is the story of his work; the story of Pilcher’s work is that of his life and death.  Considering the flying man as he appeared in the war period, there
[Line 817] entered into his composition a new element--patriotism--which brought
[Line 818] about a modification of the type, or, perhaps, made it appear that
[Line 819] certain men belonged to the type who in reality were commonplace mortals, animated, under normal conditions, by normal motives, but driven by the stress of the time to take rank with the last expression of human energy, the flying type. However that may be, what may be
[Line 820] termed the mathematising of aeronautics has rendered the type itself
[Line 821] evanescent; your pilot of to-day knows his craft, once he is trained,
[Line 822] much in the manner that a driver of a motor-lorry knows his vehicle;
[Line 823] design has been systematised, capabilities have been tabulated; camber, dihedral angle, aspect ratio, engine power, and plane surface, are
[Line 824] business items of drawing office and machine shop; there is room for enterprise, for genius, and for skill; once and again there is room for
[Line 825] daring, as in the first Atlantic flight. Yet that again was a thing of
[Line 826] mathematical calculation and petrol storage, allied to a certain stark courage which may be found even in landsmen. For the ventures into the
[Line 827] unknown, the limit of daring, the work for work’s sake, with the almost certainty that the final reward was death, we must look back to the age
[Line 828] of the giants, the age when flying was not a business, but romance.

[Line 833] VII
[Line 834]  LILIENTHAL AND PILCHER 
[Line 835] There was never a more enthusiastic and consistent student of the problems of flight than Otto Lilienthal, who was born in 1848 at Anklam, Pomerania, and even from his early school-days dreamed and
[Line 836] planned the conquest of the air. His practical experiments began when, at the age of thirteen, he and his brother Gustav made wings consisting of wooden framework covered with linen, which Otto attached to his arms, and then ran downhill flapping them. In consequence of possible derision on the part of other boys, Otto confined these experiments for the most part to moonlit nights, and gained from them some idea
[Line 837] of the resistance offered by flat surfaces to the air. It was in 1867 that the two brothers began really practical work, experimenting with wings which, from their design, indicate some knowledge of Besnier and the history of his gliding experiments; these wings the brothers fastened to their backs, moving them with their legs after the fashion of one attempting to swim. Before they had achieved any real success in
[Line 838] gliding the Franco-German war came as an interruption; both brothers served in this campaign, resuming their experiments in 1871 at the conclusion of hostilities.
[Line 839]  The experiments made by the brothers previous to the war had convinced
[Line 840] Otto that previous experimenters in gliding flight had failed
[Line 841] through reliance on empirical conclusions or else through incomplete observation on their own part, mostly of bird flight. From 1871 onward Otto Lilienthal (Gustav’s interest in the problem was not maintained as was his brother’s) made what is probably the most detailed and accurate
[Line 842] series of observations that has ever been made with regard to the properties of curved wing surfaces. So far as could be done, Lilienthal tabulated the amount of air resistance offered to a bird’s wing,
[Line 843] ascertaining that the curve is necessary to flight, as offering far more resistance than a flat surface. Cayley, and others, had already stated this, but to Lilienthal belongs the honour of being first to
[Line 844] put the statement to effective proof--he made over 2,000 gliding flights between 1891 and the regrettable end of his experiments; his practical conclusions are still regarded as part of the accepted theory of students of flight. In 1889 he published a work on the subject of gliding flight which stands as data for investigators, and, on the
[Line 845] conclusions embodied in this work, he began to build his gliders and practise what he had preached, turning from experiment with models to wings that he could use.
[Line 846]  It was in the summer of 1891 that he built his first glider of rods of peeled willow, over which was stretched strong cotton fabric; with this, which had a supporting surface of about 100 square feet, Otto
[Line 847] Lilienthal launched himself in the air from a spring board, making
[Line 848] glides which, at first of only a few feet, gradually lengthened. As his experience of the supporting qualities of the air progressed he
[Line 849] gradually altered his designs until, when Pilcher visited him in the spring of 1895, he experimented with a glider, roughly made of peeled willow rods and cotton fabric, having an area of 150 square feet and
[Line 850] weighing half a hundredweight. By this time Lilienthal had moved from his springboard to a conical artificial hill which he had had thrown up on level ground at Grosse Lichterfelde, near Berlin. This hill was made
[Line 851] with earth taken from the excavations incurred in constructing a canal, and had a cave inside in which Lilienthal stored his machines. Pilcher, in his paper on ‘Gliding,’[1] gives an excellent short summary of Lilienthal’s experiments, from which the following extracts are taken:-- 
[Line 852] ‘At first Lilienthal used to experiment by jumping off a springboard with a good run. Then he took to practising on some hills close to
[Line 853] Berlin. In the summer of 1892 he built a flat-roofed hut on the summit of a hill, from the top of which he used to jump, trying, of course, to soar as far as possible before landing.... One of the great dangers
[Line 854] with a soaring machine is losing forward speed, inclining the machine
[Line 855] too much down in front, and coming down head first. Lilienthal was the first to introduce the system of handling a machine in the air merely by moving his weight about in the machine; he always rested only on his
[Line 856] elbows or on his elbows and shoulders....
[Line 857]  ‘In 1892 a canal was being cut, close to where Lilienthal lived, in the
[Line 858] suburbs of Berlin, and with the surplus earth Lilienthal had a special hill thrown up to fly from. The country round is as flat as the sea, and there is not a house or tree near it to make the wind unsteady, so this was an ideal practising ground; for practising on natural hills is generally rendered very difficult by shifty and gusty winds.... This
[Line 859] hill is 50 feet high, and conical. Inside the hill there is a cave for the machines to be kept in.... When Lilienthal made a good flight he
[Line 860] used to land 300 feet from the centre of the hill, having come down at
[Line 861] an angle of 1 in 6; but his best flights have been at an angle of about 1 in 10. 
[Line 862] ‘If it is calm, one must run a few steps down the hill, holding the machine as far back on oneself as possible, when the air will gradually
[Line 863] support one, and one slides off the hill into the air. If there is any wind, one should face it at starting; to try to start with a side wind is most unpleasant. It is possible after a great deal of practice to
[Line 864] turn in the air, and fairly quickly. This is accomplished by throwing one’s weight to one side, and thus lowering the machine on that side
[Line 865] towards which one wants to turn. Birds do the same thing--crows and gulls show it very clearly. Last year Lilienthal chiefly experimented
[Line 866] with double-surfaced machines. These were very much like the old machines with awnings spread above them.
[Line 867] ‘The object of making these double-surfaced machines was to get more
[Line 868] surface without increasing the length and width of the machine. This, of course, it does, but I personally object to any machine in which
[Line 869] the wing surface is high above the weight. I consider that it makes
[Line 870] the machine very difficult to handle in bad weather, as a puff of wind
[Line 871] striking the surface, high above one, has a great tendency to heel the
[Line 872] machine over.  ‘Herr Lilienthal kindly allowed me to sail down his hill in one of
[Line 873] these double-surfaced machines last June. With the great facility afforded by his conical hill the machine was handy enough; but I am
[Line 874] afraid I should not be able to manage one at all in the squally districts I have had to practise in over here.
[Line 875]  ‘Herr Lilienthal came to grief through deserting his old method of
[Line 876] balancing. In order to control his tipping movements more rapidly he attached a line from his horizontal rudder to his head, so that when he
[Line 877] moved his head forward it would lift the rudder and tip the machine up in front, and vice versa. He was practising this on some natural hills outside Berlin, and he apparently got muddled with the two motions,
[Line 878] and, in trying to regain speed after he had, through a lull in the wind, come to rest in the air, let the machine get too far down in front, came down head first and was killed.’
[Line 879] Then in another passage Pilcher enunciates what is the true value of
[Line 880] such experiments as Lilienthal--and, subsequently, he himself--made: ‘The object of experimenting with soaring machines,’ he says, ‘is to
[Line 881] enable one to have practice in starting and alighting and controlling
[Line 882] a machine in the air. They cannot possibly float horizontally in the air for any length of time, but to keep going must necessarily lose in
[Line 883] elevation. They are excellent schooling machines, and that is all they are meant to be, until power, in the shape of an engine working a screw
[Line 884] propeller, or an engine working wings to drive the machine forward, is added; then a person who is used to soaring down a hill with a simple soaring machine will be able to fly with comparative safety. One can
[Line 885] best compare them to bicycles having no cranks, but on which one could learn to balance by coming down an incline.’  It was in 1895 that Lilienthal passed from experiment with the monoplane type of glider to the construction of a biplane glider which, according to his own account, gave better results than his previous machines. ‘Six or seven metres velocity of wind,’ he says,
[Line 886] ‘sufficed to enable the sailing surface of 18 square metres to carry me
[Line 887] almost horizontally against the wind from the top of my hill without any starting jump. If the wind is stronger I allow myself to be simply lifted from the point of the hill and to sail slowly towards the wind.
[Line 888] The direction of the flight has, with strong wind, a strong upwards
[Line 889] tendency. I often reach positions in the air which are much higher than
[Line 890] my starting point. At the climax of such a line of flight I sometimes come to a standstill for some time, so that I am enabled while floating
[Line 891] to speak with the gentlemen who wish to photograph me, regarding the
[Line 892] best position for the photographing.’  Lilienthal’s work did not end with simple gliding, though he did not live to achieve machine-driven flight. Having, as he considered, gained sufficient experience with gliders, he constructed a power-driven
[Line 893] machine which weighed altogether about 90 lbs., and this was thoroughly tested. The extremities of its wings were made to flap, and the driving power was obtained from a cylinder of compressed carbonic acid gas, released through a hand-operated valve which, Lilienthal anticipated,
[Line 894] would keep the machine in the air for four minutes. There were certain
[Line 895] minor accidents to the mechanism, which delayed the trial flights,
[Line 896] and on the day that Lilienthal had determined to make his trial he
[Line 897] made a long gliding flight with a view to testing a new form of rudder that--as Pilcher relates--was worked by movements of his head. His
[Line 898] death came about through the causes that Pilcher states; he fell from a height of 50 feet, breaking his spine, and the next day he died.
[Line 899]  It may be said that Lilienthal accomplished as much as any one of the great pioneers of flying. As brilliant in his conceptions as da Vinci had been in his, and as conscientious a worker as Borelli, he laid the
[Line 900] foundations on which Pilcher, Chanute, and Professor Montgomery were
[Line 901] able to build to such good purpose. His book on bird flight, published
[Line 902] in 1889, with the authorship credited both to Otto and his brother Gustav, is regarded as epoch-making; his gliding experiments are no less entitled to this description. 
[Line 903] In England Lilienthal’s work was carried on by Percy Sinclair Pilcher, who, born in 1866, completed six years’ service in the British Navy by the time that he was nineteen, and then went through a course of engineering, subsequently joining Maxim in his experimental work. It
[Line 904] was not until 1895 that he began to build the first of the series of
[Line 905] gliders with which he earned his plane among the pioneers of flight. Probably the best account of Pilcher’s work is that given in the
[Line 906] _Aeronautical Classics_ issued by the Royal Aeronautical Society, from
[Line 907] which the following account of Pilcher’s work is mainly abstracted.[2] 
[Line 908] The ‘Bat,’ as Pilcher named his first glider, was a monoplane which he completed before he paid his visit to Lilienthal in 1895. Concerning
[Line 909] this Pilcher stated that he purposely finished his own machine before going to see Lilienthal, so as to get the greatest advantage from any original ideas he might have; he was not able to make any trials with this machine, however, until after witnessing Lilienthal’s experiments and making several glides in the biplane glider which Lilienthal constructed.
[Line 910] The wings of the ‘Bat’ formed a pronounced dihedral angle; the tips
[Line 911] being raised 4 feet above the body. The spars forming the entering edges of the wings crossed each other in the centre and were lashed to
[Line 912] opposite sides of the triangle that served as a mast for the stay-wires that guyed the wings. The four ribs of each wing, enclosed in pockets
[Line 913] in the fabric, radiated fanwise from the centre, and were each stayed
[Line 914] by three steel piano-wires to the top of the triangular mast, and similarly to its base. These ribs were bolted down to the triangle at
[Line 915] their roots, and could be easily folded back on to the body when the glider was not in use. A small fixed vertical surface was carried in
[Line 916] the rear. The framework and ribs were made entirely of Riga pine; the
[Line 917] surface fabric was nainsook. The area of the machine was 150 square
[Line 918] feet; its weight 45 lbs.; so that in flight, with Pilcher’s weight of
[Line 919] 145 lbs. added, it carried one and a half pounds to the square foot. 
[Line 920] [Illustration: Rear view of Pilcher’s ‘Beetle.’] 
[Line 921] [Illustration: The ‘Beetle.’ side view.] 
[Line 922] [Illustration: Pilcher starting on glide with the ‘Bat.’] 
[Line 923] Pilcher’s first glides, which he carried out on a grass hill on
[Line 924] the banks of the Clyde near Cardross, gave little result, owing to
[Line 925] the exaggerated dihedral angle of the wings, and the absence of a
[Line 926] horizontal tail. The ‘Bat’ was consequently reconstructed with a horizontal tail-plane added to the vertical one, and with the wings lowered so that the tips were only six inches above the level of the body. The machine now gave far better results; on the first glide into
[Line 927] a head wind Pilcher rose to a height of twelve feet and remained in
[Line 928] the air for a third of a minute; in the second attempt a rope was used to tow the glider, which rose to twenty feet and did not come to earth
[Line 929] again until nearly a minute had passed. With experience Pilcher was
[Line 930] able to lengthen his glide and improve his balance, but the dropped
[Line 931] wing tips made landing difficult, and there were many breakages.  In consequence of this Pilcher built a second glider which he named
[Line 932] the ‘Beetle,’ because, as he said, it looked like one. In this the
[Line 933] square-cut wings formed almost a continuous plane, rigidly fixed to the central body, which consisted of a shaped girder. These wings were
[Line 934] built up of five transverse bamboo spars, with two shaped ribs running from fore to aft of each wing, and were stayed overhead to a couple
[Line 935] of masts. The tail, consisting of two discs placed crosswise (the horizontal one alone being movable), was carried high up in the rear. With the exception of the wing-spars, the whole framework was built of white pine. The wings in this machine were actually on a higher level
[Line 936] than the operator’s head; the centre of gravity was, consequently, very
[Line 937] low, a fact which, according to Pilcher’s own account, made the glider very difficult to handle. Moreover, the weight of the ‘Beetle,’ 80 lbs., was considerable; the body had been very solidly built to enable it to carry the engine which Pilcher was then contemplating; so that the glider carried some 225 lbs. with its area of 170 square feet-too
[Line 938] great a mass for a single man to handle with comfort.
[Line 939] It was in the spring of 1896 that Pilcher built his third glider, the ‘Gull,’ with 300 square feet of area and a weight of 55 lbs. The
[Line 940] size of this machine rendered it unsuitable for experiment in any but
[Line 941] very calm weather, and it incurred such damage when experiments were made in a breeze that Pilcher found it necessary to build a fourth, which he named the ‘Hawk.’ This machine was very soundly built, being
[Line 942] constructed of bamboo, with the exception of the two main transverse beams. The wings were attached to two vertical masts, 7 feet high, and 8 feet apart, joined at their summits and their centres by two wooden beams. Each wing had nine bamboo ribs, radiating from its mast, which was situated at a distance of 2 feet 6 inches from the forward edge of the wing. Each rib was rigidly stayed at the top of the mast by three tie-wires, and by a similar number to the bottom of the mast, by which means the curve of each wing was maintained uniformly. The tail was formed of a triangular horizontal surface to which was affixed a
[Line 943] triangular vertical surface, and was carried from the body on a high
[Line 944] bamboo mast, which was also stayed from the masts by means of steel
[Line 945] wires, but only on its upper surface, and it was the snapping of one of these guy wires which caused the collapse of the tail support and brought about the fatal end of Pilcher s experiments. In flight,
[Line 946] Pilcher’s head, shoulders, and the greater part of his chest projected
[Line 947] above the wings. He took up his position by passing his head and shoulders through the top aperture formed between the two wings, and resting his forearms on the longitudinal body members. A very simple form of undercarriage, which took the weight off the glider on the
[Line 948] ground, was fitted, consisting of two bamboo rods with wheels suspended on steel springs.
[Line 949] Balance and steering were effected, apart from the high degree of
[Line 950] inherent stability afforded by the tail, as in the case of Lilienthal’s glider, by altering the position of the body. With this machine Pilcher made some twelve glides at Eynsford in Kent in the summer of 1896,
[Line 951] and as he progressed he increased the length of his glides, and also handled the machine more easily, both in the air and in landing. He was occupied with plans for fitting an engine and propeller to the ‘Hawk,’
[Line 952] but, in these early days of the internal combustion engine, was unable to get one light enough for his purpose. There were rumours of an engine weighing 15 lbs. which gave 1 horse-power, and was reported to
[Line 953] be in existence in America, but it could not be traced. 
[Line 954] In the spring of 1897 Pilcher took up his gliding experiments again, obtaining what was probably the best of his glides on June 19th, when
[Line 955] he alighted after a perfectly balanced glide of over 250 yards in
[Line 956] length, having crossed a valley at a considerable height. From his various experiments he concluded that once the machine was launched in the air an engine of, at most, 3 horse-power would suffice for
[Line 957] the maintenance of horizontal flight, but he had to allow for the
[Line 958] additional weight of the engine and propeller, and taking into account the comparative inefficiency of the propeller, he planned for an engine of 4 horse-power. Engine and propeller together were estimated at under 44 lbs. weight, the engine was to be fitted in front of the operator,
[Line 959] and by means of an overhead shaft was to operate the propeller
[Line 960] situated in rear of the wings. 1898 went by while this engine was under construction. Then in 1899 Pilcher became interested in Lawrence
[Line 961] Hargrave’s soaring kites, with which he carried out experiments during the summer of 1899. It is believed that he intended to incorporate a number of these kites in a new machine, a triplane, of which the fragments remaining are hardly sufficient to reconstitute the complete
[Line 962] glider. This new machine was never given a trial, for on September
[Line 963] 30th, 1899, at Stamford Hall, Market Harborough, Pilcher agreed to
[Line 964] give a demonstration of gliding flight, but owing to the unfavourable weather he decided to postpone the trial of the new machine and to
[Line 965] experiment with the ‘Hawk,’ which was intended to rise from a level
[Line 966] field, towed by a line passing over a tackle drawn by two horses. At
[Line 967] the first trial the machine rose easily, but the tow-line snapped when
[Line 968] it was well clear of the ground, and the glider descended, weighed down through being sodden with rain. Pilcher resolved on a second trial, in which the glider again rose easily to about thirty feet, when one of the guy wires of the tail broke, and the tail collapsed; the machine fell to the ground, turning over, and Pilcher was unconscious when he
[Line 969] was freed from the wreckage.
[Line 970]  Hopes were entertained of his recovery, but he died on Monday, October 2nd, 1899, aged only thirty-four. His work in the cause of flying
[Line 971] lasted only four years, but in that time his actual accomplishments
[Line 972] were sufficient to place his name beside that of Lilienthal, with whom
[Line 973] he ranks as one of the greatest exponents of gliding flight.  [Illustration: ‘The Hawk’--front view.]

[Line 976] VIII 
[Line 977] AMERICAN GLIDING EXPERIMENTS  
[Line 978] While Pilcher was carrying on Lilienthal’s work in England, the great German had also a follower in America; one Octave Chanute, who, in one
[Line 979] of the statements which he has left on the subject of his experiments
[Line 980] acknowledges forty years’ interest in the problem of flight, did more
[Line 981] to develop the glider in America than--with the possible exception of Montgomery--any other man. Chanute had all the practicality of an American; he began his work, so far as actual gliding was concerned, with a full-sized glider of the Lilienthal type, just before Lilienthal was killed. In a rather rare monograph, entitled _Experiments in Flying_, Chanute states that he found the Lilienthal glider hazardous
[Line 982] and decided to test the value of an idea of his own; in this he
[Line 983] followed the same general method, but reversed the principle upon
[Line 984] which Lilienthal had depended for maintaining his equilibrium in the
[Line 985] air. Lilienthal had shifted the weight of his body, under immovable wings, as fast and as far as the sustaining pressure varied under his surfaces; this shifting was mainly done by moving the feet, as the actions required were small except when alighting. Chanute’s idea was
[Line 986] to have the operator remain seated in the machine in the air, and to
[Line 987] intervene only to steer or to alight; moving mechanism was provided
[Line 988] to adjust the wings automatically, in order to restore balance when
[Line 989] necessary.  Chanute realised that experiments with models were of little use; in order to be fully instructive, these experiments should be made with a full-sized machine which carried its operator, for models seldom fly twice alike in the open air, and no relation can be gained from them
[Line 990] of the divergent air currents which they have experienced. Chanute’s idea was that any flying machine which might be constructed must
[Line 991] be able to operate in a wind; hence the necessity for an operator
[Line 992] to report upon what occurred in flight, and to acquire practical
[Line 993] experience of the work of the human factor in imitation of bird
[Line 994] flight. From this point of view he conducted his own experiments;
[Line 995] it must be noted that he was over sixty years of age when he began,
[Line 996] and, being no longer sufficiently young and active to perform any but short and insignificant glides, the courage of the man becomes all the more noteworthy; he set to work to evolve the state required by the problem of stability, and without any expectation of advancing to the construction of a flying machine which might be of commercial value. His main idea was the testing of devices to secure equilibrium; for
[Line 997] this purpose he employed assistants to carry out the practical work,
[Line 998] where he himself was unable to supply the necessary physical energy. 
[Line 999] Together with his assistants he found a suitable place for experiments
[Line 1000] among the sandhills on the shore of Lake Michigan, about thirty miles eastward from Chicago. Here a hill about ninety-five feet high was
[Line 1001] selected as a point from which Chanute’s gliders could set off; in
[Line 1002] practice, it was found that the best observation was to be obtained from short glides at low speed, and, consequently, a hill which was
[Line 1003] only sixty-one feet above the shore of the lake was employed for the experimental work done by the party. 
[Line 1004] In the years 1896 and 1897, with parties of from four to six persons, five full-sized gliders were tried out, and from these two distinct
[Line 1005] types were evolved: of these one was a machine consisting of five tiers
[Line 1006] of wings and a steering tail, and the other was of the biplane type;
[Line 1007] Chanute believed these to be safer than any other machine previously evolved, solving, as he states in his monograph, the problem of
[Line 1008] inherent equilibrium as fully as this could be done. Unfortunately, very few photographs were taken of the work in the first year, but one
[Line 1009] view of a multiple wing-glider survives, showing the machine in flight.
[Line 1010] In 1897 a series of photographs was taken exhibiting the consecutive
[Line 1011] phases of a single flight; this series of photographs represents the experience gained in a total of about one thousand glides, but the point of view was varied so as to exhibit the consecutive phases of one single flight. 
[Line 1012] The experience gained is best told in Chanute’s own words. ‘The first thing,’ he says, ‘which we discovered practically was that the wind
[Line 1013] flowing up a hill-side is not a steadily-flowing current like that
[Line 1014] of a river. It comes as a rolling mass, full of tumultuous whirls and eddies, like those issuing from a chimney; and they strike the apparatus with constantly varying force and direction, sometimes withdrawing support when most needed. It has long been known, through
[Line 1015] instrumental observations, that the wind is constantly changing in
[Line 1016] force and direction; but it needed the experience of an operator afloat
[Line 1017] on a gliding machine to realise that this all proceeded from cyclonic
[Line 1018] action; so that more was learned in this respect in a week than had
[Line 1019] previously been acquired by several years of experiments with models.
[Line 1020] There was a pair of eagles, living in the top of a dead tree about two miles from our tent, that came almost daily to show us how such wind effects are overcome and utilised. The birds swept in circles overhead on pulseless wings, and rose high up in the air. Occasionally there
[Line 1021] was a side-rocking motion, as of a ship rolling at sea, and then the birds rocked back to an even keel; but although we thought the action was clearly automatic, and were willing to learn, our teachers were too
[Line 1022] far off to show us just how it was done, and we had to experiment for ourselves.’
[Line 1023] Chanute provided his multiple glider with a seat, but, since each
[Line 1024] glide only occupied between eight and twelve seconds, there was
[Line 1025] little possibility of the operator seating himself. With the multiple
[Line 1026] glider a pair of horizontal bars provided rest for the arms, and
[Line 1027] beyond these was a pair of vertical bars which the operator grasped
[Line 1028] with his hands; beyond this, the operator was in no way attached to
[Line 1029] the machine. He took, at the most, four running steps into the wind,
[Line 1030] which launched him in the air, and thereupon he sailed into the wind
[Line 1031] on a generally descending course. In the matter of descent Chanute observed the sparrow and decided to imitate it. ‘When the latter,’ he says, ‘approaches the street, he throws his body back, tilts his outspread wings nearly square to the course, and on the cushion of air thus encountered he stops his speed and drops lightly to the ground. So do all birds. We tried it with misgivings, but found it perfectly
[Line 1032] effective. The soft sand was a great advantage, and even when the
[Line 1033] experts were racing there was not a single sprained ankle.’
[Line 1034]  With the multiple winged glider some two to three hundred glides were
[Line 1035] made without any accident either to the man or to the machine, and the action was found so effective, the principle so sound, that full plans were published for the benefit of any experimenters who might wish to
[Line 1036] improve on this apparatus. The American _Aeronautical Annual_ for 1897
[Line 1037] contains these plans; Chanute confessed that some movement on the part of the operator was still required to control the machine, but it was only a seventh or a sixth part of the movement required for control of the Lilienthal type. 
[Line 1038] Chanute waxed enthusiastic over the possibilities of gliding,
[Line 1039] concerning which he remarks that ‘There is no more delightful sensation
[Line 1040] than that of gliding through the air. All the faculties are on the
[Line 1041] alert, and the motion is astonishingly smooth and elastic. The machine
[Line 1042] responds instantly to the slightest movement of the operator; the air
[Line 1043] rushes by one’s ears; the trees and bushes flit away underneath, and the landing comes all too quickly. Skating, sliding, and bicycling
[Line 1044] are not to be compared for a moment to aerial conveyance, in which, perhaps, zest is added by the spice of danger. For it must be
[Line 1045] distinctly understood that there is constant danger in such preliminary
[Line 1046] experiments. When this hazard has been eliminated by further evolution, gliding will become a most popular sport.’
[Line 1047]  Later experiments proved that the biplane type of glider gave better results than the rather cumbrous model consisting of five tiers of planes. Longer and more numerous glides, to the number of seven to
[Line 1048] eight hundred, were obtained, the rate of descent being about one in six. The longest distance traversed was about 120 yards, but Chanute had dreams of starting from a hill about 200 feet high, which would
[Line 1049] have given him gliding flights of 1,200 feet. He remarked that ‘In consequence of the speed gained by running, the initial stage of the flight is nearly horizontal, and it is thrilling to see the operator pass from thirty to forty feet overhead, steering his machine,
[Line 1050] undulating his course, and struggling with the wind-gusts which whistle
[Line 1051] through the guy wires. The automatic mechanism restores the angle of advance when compromised by variations of the breeze; but when these come from one side and tilt the apparatus, the weight has to be shifted
[Line 1052] to right the machine ... these gusts sometimes raise the machine from
[Line 1053] ten to twenty feet vertically, and sometimes they strike the apparatus from above, causing it to descend suddenly. When sailing near the
[Line 1054] ground, these vicissitudes can be counteracted by movements of the
[Line 1055] body from three to four inches; but this has to be done instantly, for neither wings nor gravity will wait on meditation. At a height of three hundred or four hundred feet the regulating mechanism would probably take care of these wind-gusts, as it does, in fact, for their minor variations. The speed of the machine is generally about seventeen
[Line 1056] miles an hour over the ground, and from twenty-two to thirty miles an
[Line 1057] hour relative to the air. Constant effort was directed to keep down the velocity, which was at times fifty-two miles an hour. This is
[Line 1058] the purpose of the starting and gliding against the wind, which thus furnishes an initial velocity without there being undue speed at the
[Line 1059] landing. The highest wind we dared to experiment in blew at thirty-one miles an hour; when the wind was stronger, we waited and watched the
[Line 1060] birds.’ 
[Line 1061] Chanute details an amusing little incident which occurred in the course of experiment with the biplane glider. He says that ‘We had taken one of the machines to the top of the hill, and loaded its lower wings with sand to hold it while we went to lunch. A gull came strolling
[Line 1062] inland, and flapped full-winged to inspect. He swept several circles above the machine, stretched his neck, gave a squawk and went off. Presently he returned with eleven other gulls, and they seemed to hold a conclave about one hundred feet above the big new white bird which
[Line 1063] they had discovered on the sand. They circled round after round, and once in a while there was a series of loud peeps, like those of a rusty gate, as if in conference, with sudden flutterings, as if a terrifying
[Line 1064] suggestion had been made. The bolder birds occasionally swooped
[Line 1065] downwards to inspect the monster more closely; they twisted their heads
[Line 1066] around to bring first one eye and then the other to bear, and then they rose again. After some seven or eight minutes of this performance,
[Line 1067] they evidently concluded either that the stranger was too formidable to tackle, if alive, or that he was not good to eat, if dead, and they flew off to resume fishing, for the weak point about a bird is his stomach.’  The gliders were found so stable, more especially the biplane form,
[Line 1068] that in the end Chanute permitted amateurs to make trials under guidance, and throughout the whole series of experiments not a single
[Line 1069] accident occurred. Chanute came to the conclusion that any young,
[Line 1070] quick, and handy man could master a gliding machine almost as soon
[Line 1071] as he could get the hang of a bicycle, although the penalty for any
[Line 1072] mistake would be much more severe.  At the conclusion of his experiments he decided that neither the multiple plane nor the biplane type of glider was sufficiently perfected for the application of motive power. In spite of the amount of automatic stability that he had obtained he considered that there was yet more to be done, and he therefore advised that every possible method of securing stability and safety should be tested, first with models, and then with full-sized machines; designers, he said, should make a point of practice in order to make sure of the action, to proportion and adjust the parts of their machine, and to eliminate hidden defects. Experimental flight, he suggested, should be tried
[Line 1073] over water, in order to break any accidental fall; when a series of
[Line 1074] experiments had proved the stability of a glider, it would then be time
[Line 1075] to apply motive power. He admitted that such a process would be both costly and slow, but, he said, that ‘it greatly diminished the chance
[Line 1076] of those accidents which bring a whole line of investigation into contempt.’ He saw the flying machine as what it has, in fact, been; a
[Line 1077] child of evolution, carried on step by step by one investigator after
[Line 1078] another, through the stages of doubt and perplexity which lie behind
[Line 1079] the realm of possibility, beyond which is the present day stage of actual performance and promise of ultimate success and triumph over the earlier, more cumbrous, and slower forms of the transport that we know.  [Illustration: Chanute biplane glider.] 
[Line 1080] Chanute’s monograph, from which the foregoing notes have been comprised, was written soon after the conclusion of his series of
[Line 1081] experiments. He does not appear to have gone in for further practical work, but to have studied the subject from a theoretical view-point and with great attention to the work done by others. In a paper
[Line 1082] contributed in 1900 to the American _Independent_, he remarks that
[Line 1083] ‘Flying machines promise better results as to speed, but yet will be of
[Line 1084] limited commercial application. They may carry mails and reach other inaccessible places, but they cannot compete with railroads as carriers of passengers or freight. They will not fill the heavens with commerce, abolish custom houses, or revolutionise the world, for they will be
[Line 1085] expensive for the loads which they can carry, and subject to too many weather contingencies. Success is, however, probable. Each experimenter
[Line 1086] has added something to previous knowledge which his successors can avail of. It now seems likely that two forms of flying machines, a sporting type and an exploration type, will be gradually evolved within one or two generations, but the evolution will be costly and slow, and must be carried on by well-equipped and thoroughly informed scientific men; for the casual inventor, who relies upon one or two happy inspirations, will have no chance of success whatever.’  Follows Professor John J. Montgomery, who, in the true American spirit, describes his own experiments so well that nobody can possibly do it better. His account of his work was given first of all in the American
[Line 1087] Journal, _Aeronautics_, in January, 1909, and thence transcribed in the English paper of the same name in May, 1910, and that account is here copied word for word. It may, however, be noted first that as far back as 1860, when Montgomery was only a boy, he was attracted to
[Line 1088] the study of aeronautical problems, and in 1883 he built his first machine, which was of the flapping-wing ornithopter type, and which
[Line 1089] showed its designer, with only one experiment, that he must design some other form of machine if he wished to attain to a successful flight. Chanute details how, in 1884 and 1885, Montgomery built three gliders,
[Line 1090] demonstrating the value of curved surfaces. With the first of these
[Line 1091] gliders Montgomery copied the wing of a seagull; with the second he proved that a flat surface was virtually useless, and with the third he pivoted his wings as in the Antoinette type of power-propelled aeroplane, proving to his own satisfaction that success lay in this direction. His own account of the gliding flights carried out under his direction is here set forth, being the best description of his work
[Line 1092] that can be obtained:--
[Line 1093] ‘When I commenced practical demonstration in my work with aeroplanes
[Line 1094] I had before me three points; first, equilibrium; second, complete
[Line 1095] control; and third, long continued or soaring flight. In starting I
[Line 1096] constructed and tested three sets of models, each in advance of the other in regard to the continuance of their soaring powers, but all equally perfect as to equilibrium and control. These models were tested by dropping them from a cable stretched between two mountain tops, with various loads, adjustments and positions. And it made no difference whether the models were dropped upside down or any other conceivable position, they always found their equilibrium immediately and glided safely to earth.  ‘Then I constructed a large machine patterned after the first model, and with the assistance of three cowboy friends personally made a
[Line 1097] number of flights in the steep mountains near San Juan (a hundred miles distant). In making these flights I simply took the aeroplane
[Line 1098] and made a running jump. These tests were discontinued after I put my foot into a squirrel hole in landing and hurt my leg. 
[Line 1099] The following year I commenced the work on a larger scale, by engaging aeronauts to ride my aeroplane dropped from balloons. During this work I used five hot-air balloons and one gas balloon, five or six aeroplanes, three riders--Maloney, Wilkie, and Defolco--and had sixteen applicants on my list, and had a training station to prepare any when I needed them.
[Line 1100]  ‘Exhibitions were given in Santa Cruz, San Jose, Santa Clara, Oakland, and Sacramento. The flights that were made, instead of being haphazard affairs, were in the order of safety and development. In the first flight of an aeronaut the aeroplane was so arranged that the rider had little liberty of action, consequently he could make only a limited
[Line 1101] flight. In some of the first flights, the aeroplane did little more than settle in the air. But as the rider gained experience in each
[Line 1102] successive flight I changed the adjustments, giving him more liberty of
[Line 1103] action, so he could obtain longer flights and more varied movements in the flights. But in none of the flights did I have the adjustments so
[Line 1104] that the riders had full liberty, as I did not consider that they had the requisite knowledge and experience necessary for their safety; and
[Line 1105] hence, none of my aeroplanes were launched so arranged that the rider
[Line 1106] could make adjustments necessary for a full flight. 
[Line 1107] ‘This line of action caused a good deal of trouble with aeronauts or riders, who had unbounded confidence and wanted to make long flights after the first few trials; but I found it necessary, as they seemed
[Line 1108] slow in comprehending the important elements and were willing to take risks. To give them the full knowledge in these matters I was
[Line 1109] formulating plans for a large starting station on the Mount Hamilton Range from which I could launch an aeroplane capable of carrying two,
[Line 1110] one of my aeronauts and myself, so I could teach him by demonstration. But the disasters consequent on the great earthquake completely stopped all my work on these lines. The flights that were given were only the
[Line 1111] first of the series with aeroplanes patterned after the first model. There were no aeroplanes constructed according to the two other models, as I had not given the full demonstration of the workings of the first,
[Line 1112] though some remarkable and startling work was done. On one occasion Maloney, in trying to make a very short turn in rapid flight, pressed very hard on the stirrup which gives a screw-shape to the wings, and
[Line 1113] made a side somersault. The course of the machine was very much like
[Line 1114] one turn of a corkscrew. After this movement the machine continued
[Line 1115] on its regular course. And afterwards Wilkie, not to be outdone by
[Line 1116] Maloney, told his friends he would do the same, and in a subsequent
[Line 1117] flight made two side somersaults, one in one direction and the other in an opposite, then made a deep dive and a long glide, and, when about
[Line 1118] three hundred feet in the air, brought the aeroplane to a sudden stop
[Line 1119] and settled to the earth. After these antics, I decreased the extent of
[Line 1120] the possible change in the form of wing-surface, so as to allow only straight sailing or only long curves in turning.  ‘During my work I had a few carping critics that I silenced by this
[Line 1121] standing offer: If they would deposit a thousand dollars I would cover
[Line 1122] it on this proposition. I would fasten a 150 pound sack of sand in the rider’s seat, make the necessary adjustments, and send up an aeroplane upside down with a balloon, the aeroplane to be liberated by a time
[Line 1123] fuse. If the aeroplane did not immediately right itself, make a flight, and come safely to the ground, the money was theirs.  ‘Now a word in regard to the fatal accident. The circumstances are
[Line 1124] these: The ascension was given to entertain a military company in which
[Line 1125] were many of Maloney’s friends, and he had told them he would give the
[Line 1126] most sensational flight they ever heard of. As the balloon was rising
[Line 1127] with the aeroplane, a guy rope dropping switched around the right wing
[Line 1128] and broke the tower that braced the two rear wings and which also gave control over the tail. We shouted Maloney that the machine was broken, but he probably did not hear us, as he was at the same time saying,
[Line 1129] “Hurrah for Montgomery’s airship,” and as the break was behind him, he may not have detected it. Now did he know of the breakage or not,
[Line 1130] and if he knew of it did he take a risk so as not to disappoint his
[Line 1131] friends? At all events, when the machine started on its flight the rear wings commenced to flap (thus indicating they were loose), the machine
[Line 1132] turned on its back, and settled a little faster than a parachute. When we reached Maloney he was unconscious and lived only thirty minutes.
[Line 1133] The only mark of any kind on him was a scratch from a wire on the side of his neck. The six attending physicians were puzzled at the cause of his death. This is remarkable for a vertical descent of over 2,000 feet.’  The flights were brought to an end by the San Francisco earthquake in April, 1906, which, Montgomery states, ‘Wrought such a disaster that
[Line 1134] I had to turn my attention to other subjects and let the aeroplane
[Line 1135] rest for a time.’ Montgomery resumed experiments in 1911 in California, and in October of that year an accident brought his work to an end.
[Line 1136] The report in the American _Aeronautics_ says that ‘a little whirlwind caught the machine and dashed it head on to the ground; Professor
[Line 1137] Montgomery landed on his head and right hip. He did not believe himself seriously hurt, and talked with his year-old bride in the tent. He
[Line 1138] complained of pains in his back, and continued to grow worse until he
[Line 1139] died.’ 
[Line 1140] IX
[Line 1141]  NOT PROVEN
[Line 1142]  The early history of flying, like that of most sciences, is replete with tragedies; in addition to these it contains one mystery concerning Clement Ader, who was well known among European pioneers in the development of the telephone, and first turned his attention to the
[Line 1143] problems of mechanical flight in 1872. At the outset he favoured the
[Line 1144] ornithopter principle, constructing a machine in the form of a bird
[Line 1145] with a wing-spread of twenty-six feet; this, according to Ader’s conception, was to fly through the efforts of the operator. The result of such an attempt was past question and naturally the machine never
[Line 1146] left the ground.
[Line 1147] A pause of nineteen years ensued, and then in 1886 Ader turned his
[Line 1148] mind to the development of the aeroplane, constructing a machine of bat-like form with a wing-spread of about forty-six feet, a weight of eleven hundred pounds, and a steam-power plant of between twenty and thirty horse-power driving a four-bladed tractor screw. On October 9th,
[Line 1149] 1890, the first trials of this machine were made, and it was alleged to have flown a distance of one hundred and sixty-four feet. Whatever truth there may be in the allegation, the machine was wrecked through
[Line 1150] deficient equilibrium at the end of the trial. Ader repeated the construction, and on October 14th, 1897, tried out his third machine at the military establishment at Satory in the presence of the French
[Line 1151] military authorities, on a circular track specially prepared for the experiment. Ader and his friends alleged that a flight of nearly a thousand feet was made; again the machine was wrecked at the end of the
[Line 1152] trial, and there Ader’s practical work may be said to have ended, since
[Line 1153] no more funds were forthcoming for the subsidy of experiments.  There is the bald narrative, but it is worthy of some amplification. If Ader actually did what he claimed, then the position which the Wright Brothers hold as first to navigate the air in a power-driven plane is
[Line 1154] nullified. Although at this time of writing it is not a quarter of a
[Line 1155] century since Ader’s experiment in the presence of witnesses competent to judge on his accomplishment, there is no proof either way, and
[Line 1156] whether he was or was not the first man to fly remains a mystery in the story of the conquest of the air.
[Line 1157]  The full story of Ader’s work reveals a persistence and determination to solve the problem that faced him which was equal to that of Lilienthal. He began by penetrating into the interior of Algeria after
[Line 1158] having disguised himself as an Arab, and there he spent some months in studying flight as practised by the vultures of the district. Returning
[Line 1159] to France in 1886 he began to construct the ‘Eole,’ modelling it, not on the vulture, but in the shape of a bat. Like the Lilienthal and Pilcher gliders this machine was fitted with wings which could be
[Line 1160] folded; the first flight made, as already noted, on October 9th, 1890,
[Line 1161] took place in the grounds of the chateau d’Amainvilliers, near Bretz; two fellow-enthusiasts named Espinosa and Vallier stated that a flight
[Line 1162] was actually made; no statement in the history of aeronautics has been
[Line 1163] subject of so much question, and the claim remains unproved.  It was in September of 1891 that Ader, by permission of the Minister of War, moved the ‘Eole’ to the military establishment at Satory for the
[Line 1164] purpose of further trial. By this time, whether he had flown or not,
[Line 1165] his nineteen years of work in connection with the problems attendant on mechanical flight had attracted so much attention that henceforth
[Line 1166] his work was subject to the approval of the military authorities, for
[Line 1167] already it was recognised that an efficient flying machine would confer
[Line 1168] an inestimable advantage on the power that possessed it in the event
[Line 1169] of war. At Satory the ‘Eole’ was alleged to have made a flight of 109 yards, or, according to another account, 164 feet, as stated above, in the trial in which the machine wrecked itself through colliding with some carts which had been placed near the track--the root cause of this
[Line 1170] accident, however, was given as deficient equilibrium.
[Line 1171]  Whatever the sceptics may say, there is reason for belief in the
[Line 1172] accomplishment of actual flight by Ader with his first machine in the
[Line 1173] fact that, after the inevitable official delay of some months, the
[Line 1174] French War Ministry granted funds for further experiment. Ader named
[Line 1175] his second machine, which he began to build in May, 1892, the ‘Avion,’
[Line 1176] and--an honour which he well deserves--that name remains in French aeronautics as descriptive of the power-driven aeroplane up to this day.  This second machine, however, was not a success, and it was not
[Line 1177] until 1897 that the second ‘Avion,’ which was the third power-driven aeroplane of Ader’s construction, was ready for trial. This was fitted with two steam motors of twenty horse-power each, driving two
[Line 1178] four-bladed propellers; the wings warped automatically: that is to say, if it were necessary to raise the trailing edge of one wing on the
[Line 1179] turn, the trailing edge of the opposite wing was also lowered by the
[Line 1180] same movement; an undercarriage was also fitted, the machine running on three small wheels, and levers controlled by the feet of the aviator
[Line 1181] actuated the movement of the tail planes. 
[Line 1182] On October the 12th, 1897, the first trials of this ‘Avion’ were made in the presence of General Mensier, who admitted that the machine made
[Line 1183] several hops above the ground, but did not consider the performance as
[Line 1184] one of actual flight. The result was so encouraging, in spite of the
[Line 1185] partial failure, that, two days later, General Mensier, accompanied by
[Line 1186] General Grillon, a certain Lieutenant Binet, and two civilians named respectively Sarrau and Leaute, attended for the purpose of giving the
[Line 1187] machine an official trial, over which the great controversy regarding
[Line 1188] Ader’s success or otherwise may be said to have arisen. 
[Line 1189] [Illustration: Course of the Avion’s Flight, October 14, 1897.]
[Line 1190]  We will take first Ader’s own statement as set out in a very competent account of his work published in Paris in 1910. Here are Ader’s own words: ‘After some turns of the propellers, and after travelling a few
[Line 1191] metres, we started off at a lively pace; the pressure-gauge registered about seven atmospheres; almost immediately the vibrations of the rear
[Line 1192] wheel ceased; a little later we only experienced those of the front
[Line 1193] wheels at intervals. Unhappily, the wind became suddenly strong, and we had some difficulty in keeping the “Avion” on the white line. We increased the pressure to between eight and nine atmospheres, and
[Line 1194] immediately the speed increased considerably, and the vibrations of the
[Line 1195] wheels were no longer sensible; we were at that moment at the point marked G in the sketch; the “Avion” then found itself freely supported
[Line 1196] by its wings; under the impulse of the wind it continually tended to go outside the (prepared) area to the right, in spite of the action of the rudder. On reaching the point V it found itself in a very critical
[Line 1197] position; the wind blew strongly and across the direction of the white line which it ought to follow; the machine then, although still going forward, drifted quickly out of the area; we immediately put over the
[Line 1198] rudder to the left as far as it would go; at the same time increasing the pressure still more, in order to try to regain the course. The “Avion” obeyed, recovered a little, and remained for some seconds headed towards its intended course, but it could not struggle against
[Line 1199] the wind; instead of going back, on the contrary it drifted farther and
[Line 1200] farther away. And ill-luck had it that the drift took the direction towards part of the School of Musketry, which was guarded by posts and
[Line 1201] barriers. Frightened at the prospect of breaking ourselves against these obstacles, surprised at seeing the earth getting farther away
[Line 1202] from under the “Avion,” and very much impressed by seeing it rushing sideways at a sickening speed, instinctively we stopped everything. What passed through our thoughts at this moment which threatened a
[Line 1203] tragic turn would be difficult to set down. All at once came a great shock, splintering, a heavy concussion: we had landed.’ 
[Line 1204] Thus speaks the inventor; the cold official mind gives out a different account, crediting the ‘Avion’ with merely a few hops, and to-day,
[Line 1205] among those who consider the problem at all, there is a little group which persists in asserting that to Ader belongs the credit of the first power-driven flight, while a larger group is equally persistent in stating that, save for a few ineffectual hops, all three wheels of the machine never left the ground. It is past question that the ‘Avion’ was capable of power-driven flight; whether it achieved it or no
[Line 1206] remains an unsettled problem.  [Illustration: Clement Ader’s ‘Avion,’ with wings partly folded.]
[Line 1207] Ader’s work is negative proof of the value of such experiments as
[Line 1208] Lilienthal, Pilcher, Chanute, and Montgomery conducted; these four set
[Line 1209] to work to master the eccentricities of the air before attempting to
[Line 1210] use it as a supporting medium for continuous flight under power; Ader
[Line 1211] attacked the problem from the other end; like many other experimenters
[Line 1212] he regarded the air as a stable fluid capable of giving such support to
[Line 1213] his machine as still water might give to a fish, and he reckoned that he had only to produce the machine in order to achieve flight. The wrecked ‘Avion’ and the refusal of the French War Ministry to grant any
[Line 1214] more funds for further experiment are sufficient evidence of the need
[Line 1215] for working along the lines taken by the pioneers of gliding rather than on those which Ader himself adopted.  Let it not be thought that in this comment there is any desire to derogate from the position which Ader should occupy in any study of
[Line 1216] the pioneers of aeronautical enterprise. If he failed, he failed
[Line 1217] magnificently, and if he succeeded, then the student of aeronautics does him an injustice and confers on the Brothers Wright an honour
[Line 1218] which, in spite of the value of their work, they do not deserve. There
[Line 1219] was one earlier than Ader, Alphonse Penaud, who, in the face of a
[Line 1220] lesser disappointment than that which Ader must have felt in gazing on the wreckage of his machine, committed suicide; Ader himself, rendered unable to do more, remained content with his achievement, and with the knowledge that he had played a good part in the long search which must eventually end in triumph. Whatever the world might say, he himself was
[Line 1221] certain that he had achieved flight. This, for him, was perforce enough.  Before turning to consideration of the work accomplished by the Brothers Wright, and their proved conquest of the air, it is necessary
[Line 1222] first to sketch as briefly as may be the experimental work of Sir (then Mr) Hiram Maxim, who, in his book, _Artificial and Natural Flight_, has given a fairly complete account of his various experiments. He began by
[Line 1223] experimenting with models, with screw-propelled planes so attached to a
[Line 1224] horizontal movable arm that when the screw was set in motion the plane
[Line 1225] described a circle round a central point, and, eventually, he built a
[Line 1226] giant aeroplane having a total supporting area of 1,500 square feet,
[Line 1227] and a wing-span of fifty feet. It has been thought advisable to give
[Line 1228] a fairly full description of the power plant used to the propulsion
[Line 1229] of this machine in the section devoted to engine development. The
[Line 1230] aeroplane, as Maxim describes it, had five long and narrow planes
[Line 1231] projecting from each side, and a main or central plane of pterygoid aspect. A fore and aft rudder was provided, and had all the auxiliary
[Line 1232] planes been put in position for experimental work a total lifting surface of 6,000 square feet could have been obtained. Maxim, however, did not use more than 4,000 square feet of lifting surface even in his
[Line 1233] later experiments; with this he judged the machine capable of lifting slightly under 8,000 lbs. weight, made up of 600 lbs. water in the
[Line 1234] boiler and tank, a crew of three men, a supply of naphtha fuel, and the
[Line 1235] weight of the machine itself.
[Line 1236] Maxim’s intention was, before attempting free flight, to get as much
[Line 1237] data as possible regarding the conditions under which flight must
[Line 1238] be obtained, by what is known in these days as ‘taxi-ing’--that is,
[Line 1239] running the propellers at sufficient speed to drive the machine along the ground without actually mounting into the air. He knew that he had
[Line 1240] an immense lifting surface and a tremendous amount of power in his
[Line 1241] engine even when the total weight of the experimental plant was taken into consideration, and thus he set about to devise some means of keeping the machine on the nine foot gauge rail track which had been
[Line 1242] constructed for the trials. At the outset he had a set of very heavy cast-iron wheels made on which to mount the machine, the total weight of wheels, axles, and connections being about one and a half tons.
[Line 1243] These were so constructed that the light flanged wheels which supported
[Line 1244] the machine on the steel rails could be lifted six inches above the track, still leaving the heavy wheels on the rails for guidance of the machine. ‘This arrangement,’ Maxim states, ‘was tried on several occasions, the machine being run fast enough to lift the forward end off the track. However, I found considerable difficulty in starting
[Line 1245] and stopping quickly on account of the great weight, and the amount of energy necessary to set such heavy wheels spinning at a high velocity. The last experiment with these wheels was made when a head wind was
[Line 1246] blowing at the rate of about ten miles an hour. It was rather unsteady, and when the machine was running at its greatest velocity, a sudden gust lifted not only the front end, but also the heavy front wheels completely off the track, and the machine falling on soft ground was
[Line 1247] soon blown over by the wind.’
[Line 1248]  Consequently, a safety track was provided, consisting of squared pine logs, three inches by nine inches, placed about two feet above the steel way and having a thirty-foot gauge. Four extra wheels were fitted to the machine on outriggers and so adjusted that, if the machine
[Line 1249] should lift one inch clear of the steel rails, the wheels at the ends
[Line 1250] of the outriggers would engage the under side of the pine trackway.  The first fully loaded run was made in a dead calm with 150 lbs. steam pressure to the square inch, and there was no sign of the wheels leaving the steel track. On a second run, with 230 lbs. steam pressure
[Line 1251] the machine seemed to alternate between adherence to the lower and
[Line 1252] upper tracks, as many as three of the outrigger wheels engaging at the
[Line 1253] same time, and the weight on the steel rails being reduced practically
[Line 1254] to nothing. In preparation for a third run, in which it was intended
[Line 1255] to use full power, a dynamometer was attached to the machine and the engines were started at 200 lbs. pressure, which was gradually increased to 310 lbs per square inch. The incline of the track, added to the reading of the dynamometer, showed a total screw thrust of 2,164
[Line 1256] lbs. After the dynamometer test had been completed, and everything had been made ready for trial in motion, careful observers were stationed on each side of the track, and the order was given to release the machine. What follows is best told in Maxim’s own words:--
[Line 1257]  ‘The enormous screw-thrust started the engine so quickly that it nearly threw the engineers off their feet, and the machine bounded over
[Line 1258] the track at a great rate. Upon noticing a slight diminution in the
[Line 1259] steam pressure, I turned on more gas, when almost instantly the steam commenced to blow a steady blast from the small safety valve, showing
[Line 1260] that the pressure was at least 320 lbs. in the pipes supplying the
[Line 1261] engines with steam. Before starting on this run, the wheels that were
[Line 1262] to engage the upper track were painted, and it was the duty of one of my assistants to observe these wheels during the run, while another
[Line 1263] assistant watched the pressure gauges and dynagraphs. The first part
[Line 1264] of the track was up a slight incline, but the machine was lifted clear
[Line 1265] of the lower rails and all of the top wheels were fully engaged on the upper track when about 600 feet had been covered. The speed rapidly increased, and when 900 feet had been covered, one of the rear axle trees, which were of two-inch steel tubing, doubled up and set the
[Line 1266] rear end of the machine completely free. The pencils ran completely
[Line 1267] across the cylinders of the dynagraphs and caught on the underneath end. The rear end of the machine being set free, raised considerably above the track and swayed. At about 1,000 feet, the left forward wheel also got clear of the upper track, and shortly afterwards the right
[Line 1268] forward wheel tore up about 100 feet of the upper track. Steam was at once shut off and the machine sank directly to the earth, embedding
[Line 1269] the wheels in the soft turf without leaving any other marks, showing
[Line 1270] most conclusively that the machine was completely suspended in the
[Line 1271] air before it settled to the earth. In this accident, one of the pine timbers forming the upper track went completely through the lower framework of the machine and broke a number of the tubes, but no damage was done to the machinery except a slight injury to one of the screws.’
[Line 1272]  It is a pity that the multifarious directions in which Maxim turned his energies did not include further development of the aeroplane, for it seems fairly certain that he was as near solution of the problem as Ader himself, and, but for the holding-down outer track, which was
[Line 1273] really the cause of his accident, his machine would certainly have
[Line 1274] achieved free flight, though whether it would have risen, flown and alighted, without accident, is matter for conjecture.  The difference between experiments with models and with full-sized
[Line 1275] machines is emphasised by Maxim’s statement to the effect that with
[Line 1276] a small apparatus for ascertaining the power required for artificial flight, an angle of incidence of one in fourteen was most advantageous, while with a large machine he found it best to increase his angle to one in eight in order to get the maximum lifting effect on a short run at a moderate speed. He computed the total lifting effect in the
[Line 1277] experiments which led to the accident as not less than 10,000 lbs., in
[Line 1278] which is proof that only his rail system prevented free flight.     X 
[Line 1279] SAMUEL PIERPOINT LANGLEY
[Line 1280]  
[Line 1281] Langley was an old man when he began the study of aeronautics, or, as he himself might have expressed it, the study of aerodromics, since he
[Line 1282] persisted in calling the series of machines he built ‘Aerodromes,’ a
[Line 1283] word now used only to denote areas devoted to use as landing spaces for flying machines; the Wright Brothers, on the other hand, had the great gift of youth to aid them in their work. Even so it was a great race
[Line 1284] between Langley, aided by Charles Manly, and Wilbur and Orville Wright,
[Line 1285] and only the persistent ill-luck which dogged Langley from the start
[Line 1286] to the finish of his experiments gave victory to his rivals. It has been proved conclusively in these later years of accomplished flight that the machine which Langley launched on the Potomac River in October of 1903 was fully capable of sustained flight, and only the accidents
[Line 1287] incurred in launching prevented its pilot from being the first man to
[Line 1288] navigate the air successfully in a power-driven machine.  The best account of Langley’s work is that diffused throughout a weighty tome issued by the Smithsonian Institution, entitled the _Langley Memoir on Mechanical Flight_, of which about one-third was written by Langley himself, the remainder being compiled by Charles M. Manly, the engineer responsible for the construction of the first
[Line 1289] radial aero engine, and chief assistant to Langley in his experiments. To give a twentieth of the contents of this volume in the present short account of the development of mechanical flight would far exceed
[Line 1290] the amount of space that can be devoted even to so eminent a man in aeronautics as S. P. Langley, who, apart from his achievement in the construction of a power-driven aeroplane really capable of flight, was a scientist of no mean order, and who brought to the study of
[Line 1291] aeronautics the skill of the trained investigator allied to the
[Line 1292] inventive resource of the genius.  That genius exemplified the antique saw regarding the infinite capacity for taking pains, for the Langley Memoir shows that as early as 1891
[Line 1293] Langley had completed a set of experiments, lasting through years, which proved it possible to construct machines giving such a velocity
[Line 1294] to inclined surfaces that bodies indefinitely heavier than air could
[Line 1295] be sustained upon it and propelled through it at high speed. For full
[Line 1296] account (very full) of these experiments, and of a later series leading
[Line 1297] up to the construction of a series of ‘model aerodromes’ capable of
[Line 1298] flight under power, it is necessary to turn to the bulky memoir of
[Line 1299] Smithsonian origin.
[Line 1300] [Illustration: Quarter-size model, Langley Aerodrome, in flight, 8th
[Line 1301] August, 1903.  Langley Memoir on Mechanical Flight, Smithsonian Institution,
[Line 1302] Washington.]  The account of these experiments as given by Langley himself reveals
[Line 1303] the humility of the true investigator. Concerning them, Langley remarks that, ‘Everything here has been done with a view to putting a trial aerodrome successfully in flight within a few years, and thus giving an
[Line 1304] early demonstration of the only kind which is conclusive in the eyes of the scientific man, as well as of the general public--a demonstration that mechanical flight is possible--by actually flying. All that has
[Line 1305] been done has been with an eye principally to this immediate result,
[Line 1306] and all the experiments given in this book are to be considered only as approximations to exact truth. All were made with a view, not to
[Line 1307] some remote future, but to an arrival within the compass of a few years
[Line 1308] at some result in actual flight that could not be gainsaid or mistaken.’  With a series of over thirty rubber-driven models Langley demonstrated the practicability of opposing curved surfaces to the resistance of the air in such a way as to achieve flight, in the early nineties of last century; he then set about finding the motive power which should permit of the construction of larger machines, up to man-carrying size. The
[Line 1309] internal combustion engine was then an unknown quantity, and he had to
[Line 1310] turn to steam, finally, as the propulsive energy for his power plant. The chief problem which faced him was that of the relative weight and power of his engine; he harked back to the Stringfellow engine of 1868, which in 1889 came into the possession of the Smithsonian Institution as a historical curiosity. Rightly or wrongly Langley concluded on
[Line 1311] examination that this engine never had developed and never could develop more than a tenth of the power attributed to it; consequently
[Line 1312] he abandoned the idea of copying the Stringfellow design and set about
[Line 1313] making his own engine. 
[Line 1314] How he overcame the various difficulties that faced him and constructed a steam-engine capable of the task allotted to it forms a story in itself, too long for recital here. His first power-driven aerodrome of model size was begun in November of 1891, the scale of construction
[Line 1315] being decided with the idea that it should be large enough to carry an
[Line 1316] automatic steering apparatus which would render the machine capable of
[Line 1317] maintaining a long and steady flight. The actual weight of the first
[Line 1318] model far exceeded the theoretical estimate, and Langley found that a constant increase of weight under the exigencies of construction was
[Line 1319] a feature which could never be altogether eliminated. The machine was
[Line 1320] made principally of steel, the sustaining surfaces being composed of
[Line 1321] silk stretched from a steel tube with wooden attachments. The first
[Line 1322] engines were the oscillating type, but were found deficient in power.
[Line 1323] This led to the construction of single-acting inverted oscillating
[Line 1324] engines with high and low pressure cylinders, and with admission and
[Line 1325] exhaust ports to avoid the complication and weight of eccentric and valves. Boiler and furnace had to be specially designed; an analysis
[Line 1326] of sustaining surfaces and the settlement of equilibrium while in flight had to be overcome, and then it was possible to set about the
[Line 1327] construction of the series of model aerodromes and make test of their
[Line 1328] ‘lift.’
[Line 1329] By the time Langley had advanced sufficiently far to consider it
[Line 1330] possible to conduct experiments in the open air, even with these models, he had got to his fifth aerodrome, and to the year 1894.
[Line 1331] Certain tests resulted in failure, which in turn resulted in further modifications of design, mainly of the engines. By February of 1895 Langley reported that under favourable conditions a lift of nearly sixty per cent of the flying weight was secured, but although this was much more than was required for flight, it was decided to postpone
[Line 1332] trials until two machines were ready for the test. May, 1896, came
[Line 1333] before actual trials were made, when one machine proved successful and another, a later design, failed. The difficulty with these models was
[Line 1334] that of securing a correct angle for launching; Langley records how, on launching one machine, it rose so rapidly that it attained an angle of
[Line 1335] sixty degrees and then did a tail slide into the water with its engines working at full speed, after advancing nearly forty feet and remaining in the air for about three seconds. Here, Langley found that he had
[Line 1336] to obtain greater rigidity in his wings, owing to the distortion of
[Line 1337] the form of wing under pressure, and how he overcame this difficulty
[Line 1338] constitutes yet another story too long for the telling here.
[Line 1339] Field trials were first attempted in 1893, and Langley blamed his
[Line 1340] launching apparatus for their total failure. There was a brief, but at
[Line 1341] the same time practical, success in model flight in 1894, extending
[Line 1342] to between six and seven seconds, but this only proved the need for strengthening of the wing. In 1895 there was practically no advance
[Line 1343] toward the solution of the problem, but the flights of May 6th and
[Line 1344] November 28th, 1896, were notably successful. A diagram given in Langley’s memoir shows the track covered by the aerodrome on these two flights; in the first of them the machine made three complete circles, covering a distance of 3,200 feet; in the second, that of November 28th, the distance covered was 4,200 feet, or about three-quarters of a
[Line 1345] mile, at a speed of about thirty miles an hour.
[Line 1346]  These achievements meant a good deal; they proved mechanically
[Line 1347] propelled flight possible. The difference between them and such
[Line 1348] experiments as were conducted by Clement Ader, Maxim, and others,
[Line 1349] lay principally in the fact that these latter either did or did not succeed in rising into the air once, and then, either willingly or by compulsion, gave up the quest, while Langley repeated his experiments and thus attained to actual proof of the possibilities of flight. Like these others, however, he decided in 1896 that he would not
[Line 1350] undertake the construction of a large man-carrying machine. In addition
[Line 1351] to a multitude of actual duties, which left him practically no time
[Line 1352] available for original research, he had as an adverse factor fully
[Line 1353] ten years of disheartening difficulties in connection with his model
[Line 1354] machines. It was President McKinley who, by requesting Langley to
[Line 1355] undertake the construction and test of a machine which might finally
[Line 1356] lead to the development of a flying machine capable of being used in
[Line 1357] warfare, egged him on to his final experiment. Langley’s acceptance
[Line 1358] of the offer to construct such a machine is contained in a letter
[Line 1359] addressed from the Smithsonian Institution on December 12th, 1898, to the Board of Ordnance and Fortification of the United States War
[Line 1360] Department; this letter is of such interest as to render it worthy of
[Line 1361] reproduction:-- 
[Line 1362] ‘Gentlemen,--In response to your invitation I repeat what I had the honour to say to the Board--that I am willing, with the consent of
[Line 1363] the Regents of this Institution, to undertake for the Government the further investigation of the subject of the construction of a flying machine on a scale capable of carrying a man, the investigation to include the construction, development and test of such a machine under conditions left as far as practicable in my discretion, it being understood that my services are given to the Government in such time
[Line 1364] as may not be occupied by the business of the Institution, and without charge.
[Line 1365]  ‘I have reason to believe that the cost of the construction will come
[Line 1366] within the sum of $50,000·00, and that not more than one-half of that will be called for in the coming year.  ‘I entirely agree with what I understand to be the wish of the Board that privacy be observed with regard to the work, and only when it reaches a successful completion shall I wish to make public the fact of its success.
[Line 1367] ‘I attach to this a memorandum of my understanding of some points of
[Line 1368] detail in order to be sure that it is also the understanding of the
[Line 1369] Board, and I am, gentlemen, with much respect, your obedient servant, S. P. Langley.’ 
[Line 1370] One of the chief problems in connection with the construction of a full-sized apparatus was that of the construction of an engine, for it was realised from the first that a steam power plant for a full-sized machine could only be constructed in such a way as to make it a constant menace to the machine which it was to propel. By this
[Line 1371] time (1898) the internal combustion engine had so far advanced as to convince Langley that it formed the best power plant available.
[Line 1372] A contract was made for the delivery of a twelve horse-power engine
[Line 1373] to weigh not more than a hundred pounds, but this contract was never completed, and it fell to Charles M. Manly to design the five-cylinder radial engine, of which a brief account is included in the section of this work devoted to aero engines, as the power plant for the Langley
[Line 1374] machine. 
[Line 1375] The history of the years 1899 to 1903 in the Langley series of
[Line 1376] experiments contains a multitude of detail far beyond the scope of this present study, and of interest mainly to the designer. There were
[Line 1377] frames, engines, and propellers, to be considered, worked out, and
[Line 1378] constructed. We are concerned here mainly with the completed machine
[Line 1379] and its trials. Of these latter it must be remarked that the only two
[Line 1380] actual field trials which took place resulted in accidents due to the failure of the launching apparatus, and not due to any inherent
[Line 1381] defect in the machine. It was intended that these two trials should
[Line 1382] be the first of a series, but the unfortunate accidents, and the fact
[Line 1383] that no further funds were forthcoming for continuance of experiments, prevented Langley’s success, which, had he been free to go through as he intended with his work, would have been certain. 
[Line 1384] The best brief description of the Langley aerodrome in its final form, and of the two attempted trials, is contained in the official report of Major M. M. Macomb of the United States Artillery Corps, which report is here given in full:--
[Line 1385]    REPORT    Experiments with working models which were concluded August 8 last
[Line 1386]   having proved the principles and calculations on which the design   of the Langley aerodrome was based to be correct, the next step
[Line 1387]   was to apply these principles to the construction of a machine
[Line 1388]   of sufficient size and power to permit the carrying of a man,
[Line 1389]   who could control the motive power and guide its flight, thus
[Line 1390]   pointing the way to attaining the final goal of producing a machine
[Line 1391]   capable of such extensive and precise aerial flight, under normal
[Line 1392]   atmospheric conditions, as to prove of military or commercial   utility. 
[Line 1393]   Mr C. M. Manly, working under Professor Langley, had, by the summer   of 1903, succeeded in completing an engine-driven machine which
[Line 1394]   under favourable atmospheric conditions was expected to carry a man
[Line 1395]   for any time up to half an hour, and to be capable of having its
[Line 1396]   flight directed and controlled by him. 
[Line 1397]   The supporting surface of the wings was ample, and experiment   showed the engine capable of supplying more than the necessary   motive power.
[Line 1398]    Owing to the necessity of lightness, the weight of the various   elements had to be kept at a minimum, and the factor of safety in
[Line 1399]   construction was therefore exceedingly small, so that the machine   as a whole was delicate and frail and incapable of sustaining any
[Line 1400]   unusual strain. This defect was to be corrected in later models   by utilising data gathered in future experiments under varied
[Line 1401]   conditions. 
[Line 1402]   One of the most remarkable results attained was the production of a   gasoline engine furnishing over fifty continuous horse-power for a   weight of 120 lbs.
[Line 1403]   The aerodrome, as completed and prepared for test, is briefly   described by Professor Langley as ‘built of steel, weighing   complete about 730 lbs., supported by 1,040 feet of sustaining   surface, having two propellers driven by a gas engine developing
[Line 1404]   continuously over fifty brake horse-power.’ 
[Line 1405]   The appearance of the machine prepared for flight was exceedingly   light and graceful, giving an impression to all observers of being   capable of successful flight.    On October 7 last everything was in readiness, and I witnessed the   attempted trial on that day at Widewater, Va., on the Potomac. The
[Line 1406]   engine worked well and the machine was launched at about 12.15 p.m.
[Line 1407]   The trial was unsuccessful because the front guy-post caught in   its support on the launching car and was not released in time to
[Line 1408]   give free flight, as was intended, but, on the contrary, caused the
[Line 1409]   front of the machine to be dragged downward, bending the guy-post
[Line 1410]   and making the machine plunge into the water about fifty yards in   front of the house-boat. The machine was subsequently recovered
[Line 1411]   and brought back to the house-boat. The engine was uninjured and   the frame only slightly damaged, but the four wings and rudder were   practically destroyed by the first plunge and subsequent towing
[Line 1412]   back to the house-boat. This accident necessitated the removal of
[Line 1413]   the house-boat to Washington for the more convenient repair of
[Line 1414]   damages.
[Line 1415]   On December 8 last, between 4 and 5 p.m., another attempt at a   trial was made, this time at the junction of the Anacostia with the   Potomac, just below Washington Barracks.
[Line 1416]    On this occasion General Randolph and myself represented the Board
[Line 1417]   of Ordnance and Fortification. The launching car was released at   4.45 p.m. being pointed up the Anacostia towards the Navy Yard. My
[Line 1418]   position was on the tug _Bartholdi_, about 150 feet from and at
[Line 1419]   right angles to the direction of proposed flight. The car was set
[Line 1420]   in motion and the propellers revolved rapidly, the engine working   perfectly, but there was something wrong with the launching. The
[Line 1421]   rear guy-post seemed to drag, bringing the rudder down on the
[Line 1422]   launching ways, and a crashing, rending sound, followed by the   collapse of the rear wings, showed that the machine had been
[Line 1423]   wrecked in the launching, just how, it was impossible for me to
[Line 1424]   see. The fact remains that the rear wings and rudder were wrecked
[Line 1425]   before the machine was free of the ways. Their collapse deprived   the machine of its support in the rear, and it consequently reared
[Line 1426]   up in front under the action of the motor, assumed a vertical   position, and then toppled over to the rear, falling into the water   a few feet in front of the boat. 
[Line 1427]   Mr Manly was pulled out of the wreck uninjured and the wrecked   machine was subsequently placed upon the house-boat, and the whole
[Line 1428]   brought back to Washington.
[Line 1429]   From what has been said it will be seen that these unfortunate
