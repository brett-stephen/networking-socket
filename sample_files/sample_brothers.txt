[Line 0] of the anomalies of Mr. Baskerville's character.  But he often proved good for a square meal, a day's labour and a night's rest, as many houseless folk well knew.
[Line 1] "You're the joker who calls himself the 'Duke of Drake's Island,' aren't you?"
[Line 2] "The Duke of Drake's Island" grinned and nodded.  He was a worthless
[Line 3] soul, very well known to the Devon constabulary. 
[Line 4] "Get up to the village and call at 'The White Thorn' in an hour from now, and ask for me."  "Thank you kindly, Mr. Baskerville."
[Line 5]  "We'll see about that later.  I can find a job for you to-night; but it ain't picking primroses."
[Line 6]  Priscilla Lintern met her landlord at the gate of Undershaugh.  They
[Line 7] were on terms of intimacy, and nodded to each other in an easy and friendly manner.  She had been feeding poultry from a basin, and now
[Line 8] set it down, wiped her fingers on her apron, and shook hands with Ned Baskerville.
[Line 9]  "How be you, then?  'Tis a longful time since you called on us, Master Ned."
[Line 10] "I'm clever, thank you; and I see you are, Mrs. Lintern.  And I hope
[Line 11] Cora and Phyllis be all right too.  Heathman here be growing as strong as a lion--ban't you, Heathman?"  Mrs. Lintern was a brown, good-looking woman of rather more than fifty.
[Line 12] For twenty years she had farmed Undershaugh, and her power of reserve
[Line 13] surprised a garrulous village.  It was taken by the sensible for wisdom
[Line 14] and by the foolish for pride.  She worked hard, paid her rent at the hour it was due, as Nathan often mentioned to her credit, and kept her
[Line 15] own counsel.  Very little was known about her, save that she had come to Shaugh as a widow with three young children, that she was
[Line 16] kind-hearted and might have married Mr. Gollop a year after her arrival, but had declined the honour.
[Line 17] Her daughters were at dinner when the men entered, and both rose and
[Line 18] saluted Ned with some self-consciousness.  Phyllis, the younger, was like her mother: brown, neat, silent and reserved; the elder was cast in a larger mould and might have been called frankly beautiful.
[Line 19]  Cora was dark, with black eyes and a fair skin whose purity she took pains to preserve.  She was tall, straight and full in the bosom.  Her
[Line 20] mouth alone betrayed her, for the lips set close and they were rather
[Line 21] thin; but people forgot them when she laughed and showed her pretty teeth.  Her laugh again belied her lips, for it was gentle and pleasant.  She had few delusions for a maiden, and she worked hard.  To Cora belonged a gift of common-sense.  The girl lacked sentiment, but
[Line 22] she was shrewd and capable.  She kept her mother's books and displayed
[Line 23] a talent for figures.  It was said that she had the brains of the family.  Only Mr. Baskerville himself doubted it, and maintained that
[Line 24] Cora's mother was the abler woman.  Phyllis was lost at all times in
[Line 25] admiration of her more brilliant sister, but Heathman did not like Cora and often quarrelled with her. 
[Line 26] Ned gave his message and asked for a drink of cider.  Thereupon Phyllis
[Line 27] rose from her dinner and went to fetch it.  But young Baskerville's eyes were on Cora while he drank.  He had the manner of a man very well accustomed to female society, and long experience had taught him that
[Line 28] nine girls out of ten found him exceedingly attractive.  His easy
[Line 29] insolence won them against their will.  Such girls as demanded worship and respect found Ned not so agreeable; but those who preferred the
[Line 30] male creature to dominate were fascinated by his sublimity and affectation of knowledge and worldly wisdom.  He pretended to know everything--a convincing attitude only among those who know nothing.  The talk was of a revel presently to take place at Tavistock.  "And
[Line 31] what's your gown going to be, Phyllis?" asked Ned.
[Line 32] The gown of Phyllis did not interest him in the least, but this question was put as a preliminary to another, and when the younger
[Line 33] sister told him that she meant to wear plum-colour, he turned to Cora.
[Line 34]  "Cora's got a lovely frock--blue muslin wi' little pink roses, and a
[Line 35] straw hat wi' big pink roses," said Phyllis. 
[Line 36] Ned nodded.  "I'd go a long way to see her in such a beautiful dress," he said;
[Line 37] "and, mind, I'm to have a dance or two with you both.  There's to be dancing in the evening--not rough and tumble on the grass, but boards are to be laid down and everything done proper." 
[Line 38] They chattered about the promised festivity, while Nathan and Mrs. Lintern, having discussed certain farm matters, spoke of another and a
[Line 39] nearer celebration. 
[Line 40] "You see, my brother Vivian and I are of the good old-fashioned sort,
[Line 41] and we're bent on the whole family meeting at a square feed, with good
[Line 42] wishes all round, on his seventieth birthday.  To think of him turned seventy!  I can't believe it.  Yet Time won't stand still--not even
[Line 43] with the busiest.  A family affair 'tis to be, and none asked outside ourselves." 
[Line 44] "Does Mr. Humphrey go?  He's not much of a hand at a revel."
[Line 45]  "He is not; and I thought that he would have refused the invitation.
[Line 46] But he's accepted.  We shall try our hardest to cheer him up and get a drop of generous liquor into him.  I only hope he won't be a damper and spoil the fun."
[Line 47]  "A pity he's going."
[Line 48] "We shall know that better afterwards.  'Twill be a pity if he mars
[Line 49] all; but 'twill be a good thing if we overmaster him amongst us, and
[Line 50] get him to take a hopefuller view of life and a kinder view of his fellow-creatures."
[Line 51] Ned chimed in.
[Line 52]  "You'll never do that, Uncle Nat.  He's too old to change now.  And
[Line 53] Cousin Mark be going just the same way.  He's getting such a silent, hang-dog chap, and no wonder, having to live with such a father.  I'd
[Line 54] run away if I was him." 
[Line 55] Nathan laughed.  "I believe you'd almost rather work than keep along with your Uncle
[Line 56] Humphrey," he said. 
[Line 57] "'Tis pretty well known I can work when I choose," declared Ned.  "Yes," said Heathman, with his mouth full; "and 'tis also pretty well known you never do choose."  The elder Baskerville clapped his hands. 
[Line 58] "One to you, Heathman!" he said.  "Ned can't deny the truth of that." 
[Line 59] But Ned showed no concern.  "I shall make up for lost time very easily when I do start," he said. "I've got ideas, I believe, and they go beyond ploughing.  I'm like
[Line 60] Cora here--all brains.  You may laugh, Uncle Nat, but you're not the
[Line 61] only Baskerville with a head on your shoulders.  I'll astonish you yet." 
[Line 62] "You will--you will--the day you begin to work, Ned; and the sooner the better.  I shall be very glad when it happens."
[Line 63]  The women laughed, and Cora much admired Ned's lofty attitude.  She too had ambitions, and felt little sympathy with those who were content to
[Line 64] labour on the soil.  She strove often to fire her brother and enlarge
[Line 65] his ambitions; but he had the farmer's instinct, enjoyed physical work, and laughed at her airs and graces.
[Line 66]  "Give me Rupert," said Heathman now.  "He's like me--not much good at
[Line 67] talking and ain't got no use for the girls, but a towser to work."
[Line 68] "The man who ain't got no use for the girls is not a man," declared Ned very positively.  "They're the salt of the earth--ban't they, Mrs. Lintern?" 
[Line 69] She smiled and looked at him curiously, then at his uncle; but she did
[Line 70] not answer.  "Anyway," continued Ned, "you're out when you say Rupert's like you;
[Line 71] for hard worker that he is, he's found time for a bit of love-making."  Cora and Phyllis manifested instant excitement and interest at this
[Line 72] news.  "Who is she?  You must tell us," said the elder.  "Why, I will; but say nought, for nothing be known about it outside the families, and Rupert haven't said a word himself to me.  I reckon he don't guess that I know.  But such things can't be hid from my eyes--too sharp for that, I believe.  'Tis Milly Luscombe, if you must know.  A very nice little thing too in her way.  Not my sort--a bit too independent.  I like a girl to feel a man's the oak to her ivy, but----" 
[Line 73] Uproarious laughter from his uncle cut Ned short.
[Line 74]  "Mighty fine oak for a girl's ivy--you!" he said.  "You wait," repeated the younger.  "Anyway, Rupert be sweet on Milly, and father knows all about it, and won't hear of it.  So there's
[Line 75] thunder in the air for the moment." 
[Line 76] They discussed this interesting private news, but promised Ned not to retail it in any ear.  Then he left them and, with Nathan, returned to
[Line 77] the village. 
[Line 78] Ned, undeterred by Mr. Baskerville's raillery, began loudly to praise Cora as soon as they had passed beyond earshot of the farmhouse-door.  "By Jove, she's a bowerly maiden and no mistake!  Not her like this
[Line 79] side of Plymouth, I do believe.  Haven't seen her for a month of Sundays, and she's come on amazing."  "She's a very handsome girl without a doubt," admitted Nathan.  "And a
[Line 80] very clever girl too; but a word in your ear, my young shaver: you
[Line 81] mustn't look that way once and for all."  "Why not, if I choose?  I'm a free man."
[Line 82] "You may be--now--more shame to you.  But Cora--well, your cousin Mark be first in the field there.  A word to the wise is enough.  You'll be doing a very improper thing if you look in that quarter, and I must firmly beg you won't, for everybody's sake."
[Line 83] "Mark!"
[Line 84]  "Mark.  And a very good chap he is--worth fifty of you."
[Line 85] "Mark!" repeated Ned, as though the notion was unthinkable.  "I should
[Line 86] have guessed that he would rather have run out of the country than lift
[Line 87] his eyes to a girl!"  
[Line 88]  CHAPTER IV
[Line 89]  The Reverend Dennis Masterman was a bachelor.  He came to Shaugh full of physical energy and certain hazy resolutions to accomplish notable
[Line 90] work among a neglected people.  His scholastic career was nugatory, and his intellect had offered no bar to his profession.  He was physically brave, morally infirm.  Therefore his sister, Alice Masterman, came to
[Line 91] support him and share his lot and complement his character.  She might indeed fly from cows, but she would not fly from parochial opposition.
[Line 92] She was strong where he was weak.  They were young, sanguine, and of
[Line 93] gentle birth.  They enjoyed private means, but were filled with wholesome ardour to justify existence and leave the world better than they found it.  Dennis Masterman possessed interest, and regarded this,
[Line 94] his first cure, as a stepping-stone to better things.  Shaugh Prior was too small for his natural energies and powers of endurance--so he told his sister; but she said that the experience would be helpful.  She also suspected that reform might not be a matter of energy alone. 
[Line 95] One evening, a week after their arrival, they were planning the
[Line 96] campaign and estimating the value of lay helpers, when two important
[Line 97] visitors were announced.  A maiden appeared and informed the clergyman that Thomas Gollop and Eliza Gollop desired to see him.  "Show them into the common room," said he; then he twisted a little
[Line 98] bronze cross that he wore at his watchchain and regarded Miss Masterman.  "The parish clerk and his sister--I wonder if you'd mind, Alice?" he
[Line 99] asked.
[Line 100] For answer she put down her work. 
[Line 101] "Certainly.  Since you saw Joe Voysey alone and, not only engaged him,
[Line 102] but promised he might have a boy for the weeding, I feel--well, you are a great deal too easy, Dennis.  Gollop is a very masterful person,
[Line 103] clearly, and his sister, so I am told, is just the same.  You certainly must not see women alone.  They'll get everything they want out of you." 
[Line 104] "Of course, one wishes to strike a genial note," he explained.  "First impressions count for such a lot with common people." 
[Line 105] "Be genial by all means; I say nothing against that." 
[Line 106] "Let's tackle them, then.  Gollop's a tremendous Conservative, but we must get Liberal ideas into him, if we can--in reason." 
[Line 107] Dennis Masterman was tall, square-shouldered and clean-shaven.  He
[Line 108] regarded himself as somewhat advanced, but had no intention of sowing his opinions upon the parish before the soil was prepared.  He considered his character to be large-minded, tolerant, and sane; and
[Line 109] for a man of eight-and-twenty he enjoyed fair measure of these virtues. 
[Line 110] His sister was plain, angular, and four years older than Dennis.  She wore double eyeglasses and had a gruff voice and a perceptible beard.
[Line 111]  The Gollops rose as the vicar and his sister appeared.  Miss Gollop was
[Line 112] shorter and stouter than her brother, but resembled him. 
[Line 113] "Good evening, your reverence; good evening, miss," said the parish clerk.  "This is my sister, Miss Eliza.  For faith, hope, and charity
[Line 114] she standeth.  In fact, a leading light among us, though I say it as should not." 
[Line 115] Mr. Masterman shook hands with the woman; his sister bowed only.  "And what does Miss Gollop do?" asked Dennis. 
[Line 116] "'Twould be easier to say what she don't do," answered Thomas.  "She's butt-woman to begin with, or as you would call it, 'pew-opener.'  Then
[Line 117] she's sick-nurse to the parish, and she's midwife, and, when free,
[Line 118] she'll do chores or cook for them as want her.  And she's got a knowledge and understanding of the people round these parts as won't be beaten.  She was Mr. Valletort's right hand, wasn't you, Eliza?" 
[Line 119] "So he said," answered Miss Gollop.  She was not self-conscious, but
[Line 120] bore herself as Fame's familiar and one accustomed to admiration.  She
[Line 121] had estimated the force of the clergyman's character from his first
[Line 122] sermon, and judged that her brother would be a match for him.  Now she
[Line 123] covertly regarded Miss Masterman, and perceived that here must lie any issue of battle that might arise.
[Line 124]  "Do you abide along with your brother, miss, or be you just settling
[Line 125] him into the vicarage?" she asked.  "I live with him." 
[Line 126] Miss Gollop inclined her head. 
[Line 127] "And I'm sure I hope, if I can serve you any way at any time, as you'll let me know." 
[Line 128] "Thank you.  Everybody can serve us: we want help from one and all,"
[Line 129] said Mr. Masterman.
[Line 130]  "Ezacally so!" said Thomas.  "And you must larn each man's value from
[Line 131] those that know it--not by bitter experience.  Likewise with the women.
[Line 132] My sister can tell you, to threepence a day, what any female in this parish be good for; and as to the men, you'll do very well to come to me.  I know 'em all--old and young--and their characters and their
[Line 133] points--good and bad, crooked and odd.  For we've got some originals
[Line 134] among us, and I'm not going to deny it, haven't us, Eliza?"
[Line 135]  "Every place have," she said.
[Line 136]  "Might we sit down?" asked the man.  "We'm of the bungy breed, as you see, and not so clever in our breathing as we could wish.  But we'm
[Line 137] here to go through the whole law and the prophets, so to speak, and we
[Line 138] can do it better sitting."
[Line 139] "Please sit down," answered Dennis.  Then he looked at his watch.  "I
[Line 140] can give you an hour," he said.  "But I'm going to ride over to Bickleigh at nine o'clock, to see the vicar there." 
[Line 141] "And a very nice gentleman you'll find him," declared Thomas.  "Of course, Bickleigh be but a little matter beside Shaugh Prior.  We bulk
[Line 142] a good deal larger in the eyes of the nation, and can hold our heads so
[Line 143] much the higher in consequence; but the Reverend Coaker is a very good, humble-minded man, and knows his place in a way that's a high example
[Line 144] to the younger clergymen." 
[Line 145] Miss Masterman cleared her throat, but her voice was none the less gruff. 
[Line 146] "Perhaps you will now tell us what you have come for.  We are busy people," she said. 
[Line 147] Her brother deprecated this brevity and tried to tone it down, but
[Line 148] Thomas accepted the lady's statement with great urbanity.  "Miss be right," he answered.  "Busy as bees, I warrant--same as me and
[Line 149] my own sister here.  She don't wear out many chairs, do you, Eliza?"  "Not many," said Miss Gollop.  "I always say, 'Let's run about in this world; plenty of time to sit down in the next.'"  "I may tell you," added Thomas kindly, "that your first sermon went
[Line 150] down very suent.  From where I sits, along by the font, I can get a good look across the faces, and the important people, the Baskervilles
[Line 151] and the Lillicraps and the Luscombes and the Mumfords--one and all
[Line 152] listened to every word, and nodded now and again.  You'll be glad to
[Line 153] know that." 
[Line 154] "Some thought 'twas a sermon they'd heard afore, however," said Miss Gollop; "but no doubt they was wrong."  "Quite wrong," declared Dennis warmly.  "It was a sermon written only
[Line 155] the night before I preached it.  And talking of the font----"
[Line 156]  "Yes, of course, you've marked the famous font-cover over the holy basin, I suppose?" interrupted Mr. Gollop.  "'Tis the joy and pride of
[Line 157] the church-town, I assure you.  Not another like it in the world, they say.  Learned men come all across England to see it--as well they may." 
[Line 158] The famous font-cover, with its eight little snub-nosed saints and the
[Line 159] Abbot elevated in the midst, was a special glory of St. Edward's.
[Line 160] "I meant to speak of that," said the clergyman.  "The figure at the top has got more than his proper vestments on, Gollop.  In fact, he's
[Line 161] wrapped up in cobwebs.  That is not worthy of us.  Please see they are cleaned off."
[Line 162]  "I hadn't noticed them; but since you say so--I'll look to it myself.
[Line 163] Where the vamp-dish be concerned I allow none to meddle.  It shall be done; but I must say again that I haven't noticed any cobwebs--not last Sunday.  Have you, Eliza?" said Thomas.  "No, I have not," answered his sister.
[Line 164]  "The dirt has clearly been there for months," remarked Miss Masterman.
[Line 165]  There was a painful pause, during which Miss Gollop gazed at the
[Line 166] vicar's sister and then at the vicar.
[Line 167] "'Tis a well-known fact that spiders will spin," she said vaguely, but not without intention.  The other woman ignored her and turned to Thomas.
[Line 168]  "Will you be so good as to proceed?"
[Line 169] "Yes, and gladly, miss," he answered.  "And I'll begin with the
[Line 170] Gollops, since they've done as much for this parish as anybody, living or dead.  My father was parish clerk afore me, and a very remarkable man, wasn't he, Eliza?"  "He was." 
[Line 171] "A remarkable man with a large faith in the power of prayer, was father.  You don't see such faith now, worse luck.  But he believed more than even I hold to, or my sister, either.  You might say that he wasn't right always; but none ever dared to doubt the high religious quality of the man.  But there he was--a pillar of the Church and State, as they say.  He used to help his money a bit by the power of prayer; and they fetched childer sick of the thrush to him; and he'd tak 'em up the church tower and hold 'em over the battlements, north,
[Line 172] south, east, and west--while he said the Lord's Prayer four times.
[Line 173] He'd get a shilling by it every time, and was known to do twenty of 'em in a good year, though I never heard 'twas a very quick cure.  But
[Line 174] faith moves mountains, and he may have done more good than appeared to human eyes.  And then in his age, he very near let a heavy babby drop
[Line 175] over into the churchyard--just grabbed hold of un by a miracle and saved un.  So that proper terrified the old man, and he never done
[Line 176] another for fear of some lasting misfortune.  Not but what a few
[Line 177] devilish-natured people said that if 'twas knowed he let the childer fall now and again, he'd brisk up his business a hundred per centum.
[Line 178] Which shows the evil-mindedness of human nature."  "I'll have no gross superstition of that sort here," said Mr. Masterman
[Line 179] firmly.
[Line 180]  "No more won't I," answered Thomas.  "'Other times, other manners,' as the saying is.  Have no fear.  The church is very safe with me and
[Line 181] Eliza for watch-dogs.  Well, so much for my father.  There was only us
[Line 182] two, and we never married--too busy for that.  And we've done no little
[Line 183] for Shaugh Prior, as will be better told you in good time by other
[Line 184] mouths than ours." 
[Line 185] He stopped to take breath, and Miss Masterman spoke.  "My brother will tell you that with regard to parish clerks the times
[Line 186] are altering too," she said. 
[Line 187] "And don't I know it?" he answered.  "Why, good powers, you can't get a clerk for love or money nowadays!  They'm regular dying out.  'He'll be thankful he've got one of the good old sort,' I said to my sister. 'For he'd have had to look beyond Dartymoor for such another as me.'
[Line 188] And so he would."
[Line 189] "That's true," declared Miss Gollop.  "I mean that the congregation takes the place of the clerk in most
[Line 190] modern services," continued Miss Masterman.  "In point of fact, we
[Line 191] shall not want exactly what you understand by a 'clerk.'  'Other times, other manners,' as you very wisely remarked just now."
[Line 192]  Mr. Gollop stared. 
[Line 193] "Not want a clerk!" he said.  "Woman alive, you must be daft!"
[Line 194] "I believe not," answered Miss Masterman.  "However, what my brother
[Line 195] has got to say regarding his intentions can come later.  For the
[Line 196] present he will hear you."
[Line 197] "If you don't want a clerk, I've done," answered Mr. Gollop blankly. "But I'll make bold to think you can't ezacally mean that.  Us'll leave it, and I'll tell my tale about the people.  The Lillicraps be a harmless folk, and humble and fertile as coneys.  You'll have no
[Line 198] trouble along with them.  The Baskervilles be valuable and powerful;
[Line 199] and Mr. Humphrey and his son is Church, and Mr. Vivian and his family is Church also, and his darters sing in the choir."  "We shall manage without women in the choir," said Miss Masterman.
[Line 200] "You may think so, but I doubt it," answered Eliza Gollop almost fiercely.  "You'll have to manage without anybody in the church also, if you be for up-turning the whole order of divine service!"  She was
[Line 201] excited, and her large bosom heaved.
[Line 202]  "Not up-turning--not up-turning," declared the clergyman.  "Call it reorganisation.  Frankly, I propose a surpliced choir.  I have the
[Line 203] bishop's permission; he wishes it.  Now, go on."
[Line 204]  "Then the Lord help you," said Thomas.  "We'd better be going, Eliza. We've heard almost enough for one evening." 
[Line 205] "Be reasonable," urged Miss Masterman with admirable self-command.  "We are here to do our duty.  We hope and expect to be helped by all
[Line 206] sensible people--not hindered.  Let Mr. Gollop tell us what he came to
[Line 207] tell us."
[Line 208] "Well--as to reason--I ask no more, but where is it?" murmured Thomas. "'Twas the Baskervilles," he continued, wiping his forehead.  "The other of 'em--Nathan--be unfortunately a chapel member; and if you be
[Line 209] going to play these here May games in the House of the Lord, I'm very
[Line 210] much afeared he'll draw a good few after him.  They won't stand it--mark me."
[Line 211] "Where do the people at Undershaugh worship?  I did not see Mrs.
[Line 212] Lintern and her family last Sunday."
[Line 213] "They'm all chapel too." 
[Line 214] Mr. Masterman nodded.  "Thank you for these various facts.  Is there anything more?"
[Line 215] "I've only just begun.  But I comed with warnings chiefly.  There be
[Line 216] six Radicals in this parish, and only six." 
[Line 217] "Though the Lord knows how many there will be when they hear about the
[Line 218] choir," said Eliza Gollop.  "I'm an old-fashioned Liberal myself," declared the vicar.  "But I hope your Radicals are sound churchmen, whatever else they may be." 
[Line 219] "Humphrey Baskerville is--and so's his son."  "Is that young Mark Baskerville?"
[Line 220]  "Yes--tenor bell among the ringers.  A very uneven-minded man.  He's a wonderful ringer and wrapped up in tenor bell, as if 'twas a heathen idol.  In fact, he'm not the good Christian he might be, and he'll ring oftener than he'll pray.  Then Saul Luscombe to Trowlesworthy
[Line 221] Warren--farmer and rabbit-catcher--be a very hard nut, and so's his man, Jack Head.  You won't get either of them inside the church.  They say in their wicked way they ain't got no need for sleeping after breakfast of a Sunday--atheists, in fact.  The other labouring man from
[Line 222] Trowlesworthy is a good Christian, however.  He can read, but 'tis doubtful whether he can write."
[Line 223] "You'll have to go to keep your appointment, Dennis," remarked his sister.
[Line 224] "Plenty of time.  Is there anything more that's particularly important, Gollop?"  "Lots more.  Still, if I'm to be shouted down every minute----  I comed
[Line 225] to encourage and fortify you.  I comed to tell you to have no fear, because me and sister was on your side, and always ready to fight to
[Line 226] the death for righteousness.  But you've took the wind out of our
[Line 227] sails, in a manner of speaking.  If you ban't going to walk in the old paths, I'm terrible afraid you'll find us against you."
[Line 228] "This is impertinence," said Miss Masterman. 
[Line 229] "Not at all," answered the clerk's sister.  "It's sense.  'Tis a free
[Line 230] country, and if you'm going to set a lot of God-fearing, right-minded, sensible people by the ears, the sin be on your shoulders.  You'd best
[Line 231] to come home, Thomas."
[Line 232]  Mr. Masterman looked helplessly at his watch. 
[Line 233] "We shall soon arrive at--at--a _modus vivendi_," he said.
[Line 234]  "I don't know what that may be, your reverence," she answered; "but if
[Line 235] 'tis an empty church, and sour looks, and trouble behind every hedge, then you certainly will arrive at it--and even sooner than you think
[Line 236] for." 
[Line 237] "He's going to give ear to the Radicals--'tis too clear," moaned Thomas, as he rose and picked up his hat. 
[Line 238] "I can only trust that you two good people do not represent the
[Line 239] parish," continued the vicar.
[Line 240]  "You'll terrible soon find as we do," said Miss Gollop. 
[Line 241] "So much the worse.  However, it is well that we understand one another.  Next Sunday I shall invite my leading parishioners to meet me
[Line 242] in the schoolroom on the following evening.  I shall then state my intentions, and listen to the opinions and objections of every man among you." 
[Line 243] "And only the men will be invited to the meeting," added Miss Masterman.
[Line 244] "'Tis a parlous come-along-of-it," moaned the parish clerk.  "I meant
[Line 245] well.  You can bear me out, Eliza, that I meant well--never man meant
[Line 246] better." 
[Line 247] "Good evening," said Miss Masterman, and left them.  "Be sure that we shall soon settle down," prophesied the vicar.  "I
[Line 248] know you mean well, Gollop; and I mean well, too.  Where sensible
[Line 249] people are concerned, friction is reduced to a minimum.  We shall very
[Line 250] soon understand one another and respect one another's opinions."
[Line 251]  "If you respect people's opinions, you abide by 'em," declared Miss Gollop.
[Line 252]  "Us shan't be able to keep the cart on the wheels--not with a
[Line 253] night-gowned choir," foretold her brother.  Then Dennis saw them to the door; they took their leave, and as they
[Line 254] went down the vicarage drive, their voices bumbled together, like two slow, shard-borne beetles droning on the night.
[Line 255]  
[Line 256]  
[Line 257] CHAPTER V 
[Line 258] Both the yeoman and gentle families of Devon have undergone a wide and
[Line 259] deep disintegration during the recent past.  Many are swept away, and
[Line 260] the downfall dates back beyond the eighteenth century, when war, dice, and the bottle laid foundations of subsequent ruin; but the descendants of many an ancient stock are still with us, and noble names shall be found at the plough-handle; historical patronymics, on the land.
[Line 261]  The race of Baskerville had borne arms and stood for the king in Stuart
[Line 262] times.  The family was broken in the Parliamentary Wars and languished for certain centuries; then it took heart and lifted head once more. The three brothers who now carried on their line were doubly enriched, for their father had died in good case and left a little fortune behind
[Line 263] him; while an uncle, blessed with some tincture of the gipsy blood that
[Line 264] had flowed into the native stock a hundred years before, found Devon too small a theatre for his activities and migrated to Australia.  He died a bachelor, and left his money to his nephews.  Thus the trio began life under fortunate circumstances; and it appeared
[Line 265] that two had prospered and justified existence; while concerning the
[Line 266] other little could be affirmed, save a latent and general dislike
[Line 267] founded on vague hearsay. 
[Line 268] They were different as men well could be, yet each displayed strong individuality and an assertive temperament.  All inherited some
[Line 269] ancestral strength, but disparities existed between their tastes, their
[Line 270] judgments, and their ambitions.  Vivian Baskerville was generous, self-opinionated, and kind-hearted.
[Line 271] He loved, before all things, work, yet, in direct opposition to this
[Line 272] ruling passion, tolerated and spoiled a lazy eldest son.  From the rest
[Line 273] of his family he exacted full measure of labour and very perfect obedience.  He was a man of crystallised opinions--one who resented change, and built on blind tradition.  Nathan Baskerville had a volatile and swift-minded spirit.  He was
[Line 274] sympathetic, but not so sympathetic as his manner made him appear.  He had a histrionic knack to seem more than he felt; yet this was not all acting, but a mixture of art and instinct.  He trusted to tact, to a
[Line 275] sense of humour with its accompanying tolerance, and to swift appraisal
[Line 276] of human character.  Adaptability was his watchword.
[Line 277] Humphrey Baskerville personified doubt.  His apparent chill
[Line 278] indifference crushed the young and irritated the old.  An outward
[Line 279] gloominess of manner and a pessimistic attitude to affairs sufficed to turn the folk from him.  While he seemed the spirit of negation made alive, he was, nevertheless, a steadfast Christian, and his dark mind,
[Line 280] chaotic though it continued to be even into age, enjoyed one precious attribute of chaos and continued plastic and open to impressions.  None
[Line 281] understood this quality in him.  He did not wholly understand it
[Line 282] himself.  But he was ever seeking for content, and the search had thus
[Line 283] far taken him into many fruitless places and landed him in blind alleys
[Line 284] not a few.
[Line 285]  These adventures, following his wife's death, had served to sour him in
[Line 286] some directions; and the late ripening of a costive but keen intelligence did not as yet appear to his neighbours.  It remained to
[Line 287] be seen whether time would ever achieve a larger wisdom, patience, and understanding in him--whether considerable mental endowments would ultimately lift him nearer peace and content, or plunge him deeper into despondence and incorrigible gloom.  He was as interesting as Nathan
[Line 288] was attractive and Vivian, obvious. 
[Line 289] The attitude of the brothers each to the other may be recorded in a sentence.  Vivian immensely admired the innkeeper and depended no little upon his judgment in temporal affairs, but Humphrey he did not
[Line 290] understand; Nathan patronised his eldest brother and resented Humphrey's ill-concealed dislike; while the master of Hawk House held
[Line 291] Vivian in regard, as an honest and single-minded man, but did not share the world's esteem for Nathan.  They always preserved reciprocal
[Line 292] amenities and were accounted on friendly terms.  Upon the occasion of the eldest brother's seventieth birthday, both Vivian and Nathan stood at the outer gate of Cadworthy and welcomed Humphrey when he alighted off his semi-blind pony.
[Line 293]  Years sat lightly on the farmer.  He was a man of huge girth and height above the average.  He had a red moon face, with a great fleshy jowl
[Line 294] set in white whiskers.  His brow was broad and low; his small, pig-like
[Line 295] eyes twinkled with kindliness.  It was a favourite jest with him that he weighed within a stone or two as much as his brothers put together.
[Line 296] They shook hands and went in, while Mark and Rupert took the ponies.
[Line 297] The three brothers all wore Sunday black; and Vivian had a yellow tie on that made disharmony with the crimson of his great cheeks.  This
[Line 298] mountain of a man walked between the others, and Nathan came to his ear
[Line 299] and Humphrey did not reach his shoulder.  The last looked a mere shadow beside his brother. 
[Line 300] "Seventy year to-day, and have moved two ton of sacks--a hundredweight to the sack--'twixt breaksis and noon.  And never felt better than this minute," he told them.
[Line 301] "'Tis folly, all the same--this heavy work that you delight in," declared Nathan.  "I'm sure Humphrey's of my mind.  You oughtn't to do such a lot of young man's work.  'Tis foolish and quite uncalled for." 
[Line 302] "The young men can't do it, maybe," said Humphrey.  "Vivian be three men rolled into one--with the strength of three for all his threescore
[Line 303] and ten years.  But you're in the right.  He's too old for these deeds. There's no call for weight-lifting and all this sweating labour, though he is such a mighty man of his hands still." 
[Line 304] Mr. Baskerville of Cadworthy laughed. 
[Line 305] "You be such brainy blids--the pair of you--that you haven't got no
[Line 306] patience with me and my schoolboy fun.  But, then, I never had no
[Line 307] intellects like you--all ran into muscle and bone.  And 'tis my
[Line 308] pleasure to show the young generation what strength be.  The Reverend Masterman preached from a very onusual text Sunday, 'There were giants in those days,' it was--or some such words, if my memory serves me.
[Line 309] And Rupert and May, as were along with me, said as surely I belonged to the giant race!"
[Line 310]  He laughed with a loud, simple explosion of ingenuous merriment, and
[Line 311] led the way to the parlour.
[Line 312] There his wife, in black silk, welcomed her brothers-in-law and
[Line 313] received their congratulations.  Humphrey fumbled at a parcel which he produced from his breast.  He untied the string, wound it up, and put it into his pocket.
[Line 314] "'Tis a book as I heard well spoken of," he said.  "There's only one
[Line 315] Book for you and me, I believe, Vivian; but an old man as I know came by this, and he said 'twas light in his darkness; so I went and bought a copy for you by way of something to mark the day.  Very like 'tis all rubbish, and if so you can throw it behind the fire." 
[Line 316] "Sermons, and good ones without a doubt," answered the farmer.  "I'm very fond of sermons, and I'll lay on to 'em without delay and let you know what I think.  Not that my opinion of such a thing do count; but I
[Line 317] can tell to a hair if they'm within the meaning of Scripture, and that be all that matters.  And thank you kindly, I'm sure."
[Line 318]  "Tom Gollop's got terrible down-daunted about Mr. Masterman," said
[Line 319] Nathan.  "He says that your parson is a Radical, and will bring down
[Line 320] dreadful things on the parish."
[Line 321]  "Old fool," answered Humphrey.  "'Tis just what we want, within the meaning of reason, to have a few of the cobwebs swept away."  "But you're a Radical too, and all for sweeping away," argued his eldest brother doubtfully.  "I'm for folly and nonsense being swept away, certainly.  I'm for all
[Line 322] this cant about humility and our duty to our superiors being swept
[Line 323] away.  I hate to see chaps pulling their hair to other men no better
[Line 324] than themselves, and all that knock-kneed, servile rubbish."
[Line 325]  Nathan felt this to be a challenge.
[Line 326]  "We take off our hats to the blood in a man's veins, if 'tis blue enough--not to the man."
[Line 327] "And hate the man all the time, maybe--and so act a lie when we cap to
[Line 328] him and pretend what isn't true."
[Line 329] "You go too far," declared Nathan.  "I say that we hate anything that's stronger than we are," continued
[Line 330] his brother.  "We hate brains that's stronger than our own, or pockets
[Line 331] that's deeper.  The only folk that we smile upon honestly be those we
[Line 332] reckon greater fools than ourselves."
[Line 333]  Vivian laughed loud at this.  "What a sharp tongue the man hath!" he exclaimed.  "But he's wrong, for all that.  For if I only smiled at them who had less brains than myself, I should go glum from morn till night." 
[Line 334] "Don't say it, father!" cried his wife.  "Too humble-minded you be, and always will be."
[Line 335]  "'Tis only a very wise man that knows himself for a fool, all the same," declared Nathan.  "As for Humphrey here, maybe 'tis because men
[Line 336] hate brains bigger than their own, as he says, that he hasn't got a
[Line 337] larger circle of friends himself.  We all know he's the cleverest man
[Line 338] among us."
[Line 339]  Humphrey was about to speak again, but restrained the inclination and turned to his nieces who now appeared. 
[Line 340] Polly lacked character and existed as the right hand of her mother; but May took physically after Vivian, and represented his first joy and the
[Line 341] apple of his eye.  She was a girl of great breadth and bulk every way. The beauty of youth still belonged to her clean white and red face, and
[Line 342] her yellow hair was magnificent; but it required no prophet to foretell
[Line 343] that poor May, when her present colt-like life of physical activity decreased, must swiftly grow too vast for her own comfort or the temptation of the average lover.  The youngest of the family--his Uncle Humphrey's namesake--followed his sisters.  He was a brown boy, well set up and shy.  Of all men he feared the elder Humphrey most.  Now he shook hands evasively. 
[Line 344] "Don't stare at the ceiling and the floor, but look me in the eyes.  I
[Line 345] hate a chap as glances athwart his nose like that," said the master of Hawk House.  Whereat the lesser Humphrey scowled and flushed.  Then he braced himself for the ordeal and stared steadily into his uncle's eyes.
[Line 346] The duel lasted full two minutes, and the boy's father laughed and applauded him.  At last young Humphrey's eyes fell. 
[Line 347] "That's better," said Humphrey the elder.  "You learn to keep your gaze
[Line 348] on the eyes of other people, my lad, if you want to know the truth
[Line 349] about 'em.  A voice will teach you a lot, but the eyes are the book for me--eh, Nathan?" 
[Line 350] "No doubt there's a deal in that."  "And if 'twas followed, perhaps we shouldn't take our hats off to
[Line 351] certain people quite so often as we do," added Humphrey, harking back to the old grievance.  "What's the good of being respectful to those you don't respect and ought not to respect?"  "The man's hungry!" said Vivian.  "'Tis starvation making him so crusty
[Line 352] and so clever.  Come now, ban't dinner ready?"
[Line 353]  Mrs. Baskerville had departed and Polly with her.
[Line 354]  "Hurry 'em up," cried Vivian, and his youngest son hastened to do so. 
[Line 355] Meantime Nathan, who was also hungry, and who also desired to display agility of mind before his elder brother, resumed the argument with Humphrey and answered his last question.  "Because we've everything to gain by being civil, and nought to gain by
[Line 356] being otherwise, as things are nowadays.  Civility costs nothing and
[Line 357] the rich expect it of the poor, and gentle expect it of simple.  Why
[Line 358] not?  You can't mar them by being rude; but you can mar yourself.  'The
[Line 359] golden rule for a pushing man is to be well thought upon.'  That's what our father used to say.  And it's sound sense, if you ask me.  Of course, I'm not speaking for us, but for the younger generation, and if
[Line 360] they can prosper by tact and civility to their betters, why not?  We
[Line 361] like the younger and humbler people to be civil to us; then why shouldn't they be civil to parson and squire?" 
[Line 362] "How if parson be no good, and squire a drinker or a rascal?" 
[Line 363] "That's neither here nor there.  'Tis their calling and rank and the weight behind 'em."  "Trash!" said Humphrey sourly.  "Let every man be weighed in his own
[Line 364] balance and show himself what he is.  That's what I demand.  Why should
[Line 365] we pretend and give people the credit of what they stand for, if they
[Line 366] don't stand for it?"
[Line 367]  "For a lot of reasons----" began Nathan; then the boy Humphrey returned
[Line 368] to say that dinner was ready. 
[Line 369] They sat down, and through the steam that rose from a dish of ducks
[Line 370] Humphrey looked at Nathan and spoke.  "What reasons?" he said.  "For your credit's sake you can't leave it
[Line 371] there." 
[Line 372] "If you will have it, you will have it--though this isn't the time or place; but Vivian must blame you, not me.  Life's largely a game of make-believe and pretence, and, right or wrong, we've got to suffer it. We should all be no better than lonely monkeys or Red Indians, if we didn't pretend a bit more than we meant and say a bit more than we'd
[Line 373] swear to.  Monkeys don't pretend, and what's the result?  They've all
[Line 374] gone under."  They wrangled until the food was on the plates, then Vivian, who had been puffing out his cheeks, rolling his eyes and showing uneasiness in other ways, displayed a sudden irritability.
[Line 375] "God damn it!" he cried.  "Let's have no more of this!  Be the meal to be sarved with no sauce but all this blasted nonsense?  Get the drink,
[Line 376] Rupert." 
[Line 377] Nathan expressed instant regret and strove to lift the tone of the
[Line 378] company.  But the cloud did not pass so easily.  Vivian himself soon
[Line 379] forgot the incident; his children and his wife found it difficult.  The young people, indeed, maintained a very dogged taciturnity and only
[Line 380] talked among themselves in subdued tones.  May and Polly waited upon
[Line 381] the rest between the intervals of their own meal.  They changed the
[Line 382] dishes and went to and from the kitchen.  Rupert and his youngest
[Line 383] brother helped them, but Ned did not. 
[Line 384] Some cheerfulness returned with the beer, and even Humphrey Baskerville
[Line 385] strove to assist the general jollity; but he lacked the power.  His
[Line 386] mind was of the discomfortable sort that cannot suffer opinions,
[Line 387] believed erroneous, to pass unchallenged.  Sometimes he expressed no more than doubt; sometimes he dissented forcibly to Nathan's generalities.  But after Vivian's heat at the beginning of the entertainment, his brother from 'The White Thorn' was cautious, and took care to raise no more dust of controversy. 
[Line 388] The talk ran on the new vicar, and the master of Cadworthy spoke well of him.
[Line 389] "An understanding man, and for my part, though I can't pretend to like new things, yet I ban't going to quarrel for nothing.  And if he likes
[Line 390] to put the boys in surplices and make the maidens sit with the
[Line 391] congregation, I don't see no great harm.  They can sing praises to God wi' their noses to the east just so easy as they can facing north."
[Line 392]  "Well said," declared Humphrey.  "I've no patience with such fools as Gollop." 
[Line 393] "As one outside and after a different persuasion, I can look on impartial," declared Nathan.  "And I think with you both that Masterman
[Line 394] is a useful and promising man.  As for Gollop, he's the sort that can't
[Line 395] see further than the end of the parish, and don't want to do so." 
[Line 396] "For why?  He'd tell you there's nought beyond," said Humphrey.  "He
[Line 397] foxes himself to think that the world can go on without change.  He
[Line 398] fancies that he alone of us all be a solid lighthouse, stuck up to
[Line 399] watch the waves roll by.  'Tis a sign of a terrible weak intellect to think that everybody's changeable but ourselves, and that we only be the ones that know no shadow of changing.  Yet I've seen many such
[Line 400] men--with a cheerful conceit of themselves too."
[Line 401] "There's lots like that--common as blackberries in my bar," declared Nathan.  "Old fellows most times, that reckon they are the only steadfast creatures left on earth, while everybody else be like feathers blown about in a gale of change."  "Every mortal man and woman be bound to change," answered his brother.
[Line 402] "'Tis the law of nature.  I'd give nought for a man of hard and fast opinions.  Such stand high and dry behind the times."  But Vivian would not allow this. 
[Line 403] "No, no, Humphrey; that won't do.  If us wasn't fixed and firm, the world couldn't go on."
[Line 404] "Vivian means we must have a lever of solid opinions to lift our load
[Line 405] in the world," explained Nathan.  "Of course, no grown man wants to be
[Line 406] flying to a new thing every day of his life, like the young people do."
[Line 407]  "The lever's the Bible," declared Humphrey.  "I've nought to do with any man who goes beyond that; but, outside that, there's a margin for change as the world grows, and 'tis vain to run your life away from the
[Line 408] new facts the wise men find out." 
[Line 409] "I don't hold with you," declared Vivian.  "At such a gait us would
[Line 410] never use the same soap or wear the same clothes two years together. If you'm going to run your life by the newspapers, you'm in the same
[Line 411] case with the chaps and the donkey in the fable.  What father believed and held to, I shall believe and hold to; for he was a better man than
[Line 412] me and knowed a lot more." 
[Line 413] Humphrey shook his head.
[Line 414]  "If we all thought so, the world would stand still," he replied.  "'Tis the very argument pushed in the papers to-day about teaching the young
[Line 415] people.  'Tis said they must be taught just what their parents want for 'm to be taught.  And who knows best, I should like to know--the
[Line 416] parents and guardians, as have finished their learning years ago and be miles behind-hand in their knowledge, or the schoolmasters and mistresses as be up to date in their larning and full of the latest things put into books?  There's no standing still with the world any more than there's standing still with the sun.  It can't be.  Law's against it."
[Line 417] "We must have change," admitted Nathan. 
[Line 418] "For sure we must.  'Tis the only way to keep sweet--like water running forward.  If you block it in a pond, it goes stagnant; and if you block
[Line 419] your brains, they rot." 
[Line 420] "Then let us leave it at that," said Vivian's wife.  "And now, if you men have done your drink, you can go off and smoke while we tidy up."
[Line 421]  But there was yet a duty to perform, and Nathan rose and whispered in
[Line 422] Humphrey's ear.
[Line 423] "I think the time's come for drinking his health.  It must be done.
[Line 424] Will you propose it?"
[Line 425] His brother answered aloud. 
[Line 426] "Nathan wants for me to propose your good health, Vivian.  But I ban't
[Line 427] going to.  That sort of thing isn't in my line.  I wish you nought but
[Line 428] well, and there's an end on't."
[Line 429]  "Then I'll say a word," declared the innkeeper, returning to his place.
[Line 430] "Fill your glasses--just a drop more, Hester, you must drink--isn't it to your own husband?  And I say here, in this family party, that 'tis a
[Line 431] proud and a happy thing to have for the head of the family such a man
[Line 432] as our brother--your husband, Hester; and your father, you boys and girls.  Long may he be spared to stand up among us and set us a good example of what's brave and comely in man; long may he be spared, I
[Line 433] say, and from my heart I bless him for a good brother and husband and
[Line 434] father, and wish him many happy returns of his birthday.  My love and honour to you, Vivian!"  They all rose and spoke after the custom of the clan.
[Line 435] "My love and honour to you, brother," said Humphrey.
[Line 436]  "My love and honour to you, Vivian Baskerville," said his wife. 
[Line 437] "Love and honour to you, father," murmured the boys and girls.
[Line 438] And Mark said, "Love and honour to you, uncle."  There was a gulching of liquor in the silence that followed, and Mr.
[Line 439] Baskerville's little eyes twinkled.
[Line 440]  "You silly folk!" he said.  "God knows there's small need of this.  But
[Line 441] thank you all--wife, children, brothers, and nephew.  I be getting up
[Line 442] home to my tether's end now, and can't look with certainty for over and above another ten birthdays or thereabouts; but such as come we'll keep together, if it pleases you.  And if you be drinking, then here's to you all at a breath--to you all, not forgetting my son Nathan that's sailing on the sea."
[Line 443] "I'll write to Nat and tell him every blessed word of it, and what we've had for dinner and all," said May.
[Line 444] The company grew hilarious and Nathan, leaving them, went to the trap
[Line 445] that had brought him from Shaugh Prior and returned with a bottle.  "'Tis a pretty cordial," he said, "and a thimbleful all round will steady what's gone and warm our hearts.  Not but what they'm warm
[Line 446] enough already."
[Line 447] The liquor was broached and all drank but Humphrey.  "Enough's as good as a feast.  And you can saddle my pony, Mark.  I'm going home now.  I'm glad to have been here to-day; but I'm going now."  They pressed him to remain, but he judged the invitation to be half-hearted.  However, he was tranquil and amiable at leave-taking.
[Line 448] To Rupert he even extended an invitation.
[Line 449]  Rupert was the only one of his brother's family for whom he even pretended regard. 
[Line 450] "You can come and see me when you've got the time," he said.  "I'll go for a walk along with you and hear what you have to say."
[Line 451] Then he rode off, but Mark stopped and finished the day with his
[Line 452] cousins.
[Line 453]  He talked to Rupert and, with secret excitement, heard the opinions of May and Polly on the subject of Cora Lintern. 
[Line 454] A very glowing and genial atmosphere settled over Cadworthy after the
[Line 455] departure of Humphrey Baskerville.  Even the nervous Mark consented to sing a song or two.  The musical traditions of the Baskervilles had
[Line 456] reawakened in him, and on rare occasions he favoured his friends with old ballads.  But in church he never sang, and often only went there to
[Line 457] ring the tenor bell.  Mr. Nathan also rendered certain comic songs, and May played the aged
[Line 458] piano.  Then there was dancing and dust and noise, and presently the
[Line 459] meal called 'high tea.'  Hester Baskerville protested at last against
[Line 460] her brother-in-law's absurdities, for everybody began to roll about and
[Line 461] ache with laughter; but he challenged her criticism. 
[Line 462] "Clever though you all are," he said, "no woman that ever I met was
[Line 463] clever enough to play the fool.  'Tis only the male creature can
[Line 464] accomplish that."  "No woman ever wanted to, I should hope," she answered; and he retorted
[Line 465] triumphantly--
[Line 466]  "There you are!  There's my argument in a nutshell!"
[Line 467]  She was puzzled. 
[Line 468] "What d'you mean by that?" she asked, and, from the standpoint of his nimble wit, he roared.
[Line 469]  "There you are again!" he said.  "I can't explain; but the lack in you
[Line 470] be summed in the question."  "You'm a hopeless case," she said.  "We all laugh at you, and yet couldn't for the life of us tell what on earth 'tis we be laughing at." 
[Line 471] "That's the very highest art and practice of playing the fool!" he told
[Line 472] them.
[Line 473]     CHAPTER VI
[Line 474] Where Wigmore Down descends in mighty shoulders clad with oak, there
[Line 475] meet the rivers Plym and Mew, after their diverse journeyings on
[Line 476] Dartmoor.  The first roars wild and broken from its cradle aloft on the
[Line 477] midmost waste, and falls with thunder under Cadworthy and beneath the
[Line 478] Dewerstone; the other, as becomes a stream that has run through peaceful valleys by bridges and the hamlets of men, shall be found to wander with more gentle current before she passes into the throbbing bosom of her sister.  Above them, on a day in early summer, the hill
[Line 479] ascended washed with light, spread hugely for the pomp of the leaf.
[Line 480] From Plym beneath, flashing arrowy under their lowermost branches, to the granite tonsure of the hill above, ten thousand trees ascended in a shining raiment of all greens--a garment that fitted close to the
[Line 481] contours of each winding ridge, sharp cleeve, and uplifted knoll of the elevation that they covered.  Lustrous and shimmering, this forest garb exhibited every vernal tint that nature knows, for upon a prevalent, triumphant fabric of golden-green were cast particular jewels and patterns; against the oaken undertones, where they spread a dappled
[Line 482] verdure of amber and carmine, there sprang the tardy ash, shone the
[Line 483] rowan's brightness, sparkled the whitethorn at river's brink, and rose the emerald pavilions of the larch.  Beeches thrust their diaphanous foliage in veils athwart the shadows; here a patchwork of blue firs
[Line 484] added new harmonies to the hill; here the glittering birch reflected
[Line 485] light from every tiny leaf; and here the holly's sobriety was broken by inflorescence and infant foliage, young and bright. 
[Line 486] The forest spread its new-born leaves under a still, grey evening, upon
[Line 487] which, suddenly, the sun thrust through before it sank.  Shafts of
[Line 488] light, falling from west to east upon the planes of the woods, struck
[Line 489] out a path of sudden glory along the pine-tops and thrust down in rain of red gold even to the river's face; while on Dewerstone's self, where
[Line 490] it towered above the trees and broke the green with grey, this gracious light briefly brooded and flashed genial into dark crevices and hidden
[Line 491] nests of birds.
[Line 492] The great rock falls by abrupt acclivity to the water; it towers with pinnacle and peak aloft.  Planted in the side of the forest it stands
[Line 493] veined, scarred; it is fretted with many colours, cut and torn into all
[Line 494] manner of fantastic shapes by work of roots and rain, by centuries of storm and the chisel of the lightning.  Bedded here, with ivy on its
[Line 495] front, the smile of evening for a crown, and the forest like a green sea breaking in foam of leaves around it, the Water Stone stood.  Night
[Line 496] was already come upon its eaves and cornices; from its feet ascended musical thunder of Plym in a riot of rocks; and aloft, clashing, echoing and re-echoing from scarp and precipice, there rang the cheerful chiming music of unnumbered jackdaws, who made these crags
[Line 497] their home.
[Line 498]  Mark Baskerville, descending into the valley from Shaugh, beheld this
[Line 499] scene with understanding.  He had been well educated; he was sentimental; he regarded wild Nature in a manner rare amid those born
[Line 500] and bred upon her bosom.  Beauty did not find him indifferent; old
[Line 501] legends gave him joy.  He knew the folk-tales of the land and dwelt
[Line 502] upon them still with pleasure--an instinct surviving from boyhood, and deliberately suffered to survive.  He loved the emotion of awe and
[Line 503] cultivated it; he led a life from choice much secluded; he had walked hitherto blind, in so far as women were concerned; but now a woman had entered his life, and Nature shone glorified throughout by the experience. 
[Line 504] Mark was in love with Cora Lintern; yet this prime fact did not lessen
[Line 505] his regard for the earth and the old stories concerning it.  He found
[Line 506] the things that were good aforetime still good, but changed.  His
[Line 507] emotions were all sharpened and intensified.  His strength was
[Line 508] stronger; his weakness was weaker than of yore.  She was never out of his thoughts; she made the sunlight warmer, the bird's song sweeter, the night more wonderful.  He woke and found himself brave enough to approach her in the deep, small hours of morning; but with dawn came fear, and with day his courage melted.  By night also he made rhymes
[Line 509] that seemed beautiful to him and brought moisture to his eyes; but when
[Line 510] the sun came and he repeated his stumbling periods, he blushed at them
[Line 511] and banished them. 
[Line 512] She was friendly and not averse; but she was clever, and had many
[Line 513] friends among young men.  Nathan Baskerville rejoiced in her, and often
[Line 514] foretold a notable match for Cora.  What Mark could offer seemed very little to Mark himself.  His father, indeed, was reputed rich; but life at Hawk House revealed no sign of it.  They lived hard, and Humphrey Baskerville affected a frugality that would have been unusual in the
[Line 515] homes of humbler people.  Humphrey had often told his son that he did not know how to spend
[Line 516] money; and as for Mark, until the present, he had shared his father's indifference and been well content.  But he felt that Cora might be fond of money; and he was glad sometimes that his father spent so little; because, if all went well, there must surely come a time when he would be able to rejoice Cora with great riches.  The obstacle,
[Line 517] however, he felt to be himself.  His distrust of himself was morbid; the folk said that he was frightened of his own voice, and only spoke through the tenor bell of St. Edward's. 
[Line 518] Now he descended into the shadows of the valley and moved along the brink of Plym, seeking for certain young wood, ripe for cutting.
[Line 519] Presently Mark found what he sought, but made no immediate effort to
[Line 520] begin work.  He flung down a frail which contained a bill-hook and saw. Then he sat upon a rock overhanging the river and buried himself in his
[Line 521] own thoughts.  A path wound beside the stream, and along it sauntered suddenly the
[Line 522] maiden of this man's dream.  She looked fair enough and moved in deep
[Line 523] apparent unconsciousness of any human presence. 
[Line 524] But her ignorance was simulated.  She had seen young Baskerville pass over the hill; she had known his destination, and by a detour she had entered the valley from below.
[Line 525] Now she started and exhibited astonishment. 
[Line 526] "Mark!  Whoever would have thought----!  What be you doing here all
[Line 527] alone like this--and you not a fisherman?" 
[Line 528] He stammered, and grew pale.
[Line 529] "Fancy meeting; and I might ask what brought you, Cora?" 
[Line 530] "Oh, just a silly fondness for the river and the trees and my own thoughts.  I like being about among the wild things, though I dare say you won't believe it."
[Line 531]  "Of course, I'll believe it--gladly too.  Don't I like being about
[Line 532] among 'em better than anything else?  I'm very pleased to meet you, I'm sure.  There's no lovelier bit of the river than here."
[Line 533] "Dewerstone do look fine to-night," she said, glancing up at the crags
[Line 534] above them.
[Line 535]  "It does, then.  The Water Stone I always call it, since I read in a book that that was what it meant.  'Tis the great stone by the water,
[Line 536] you see.  Have you ever heard tell of the Black Hunter, Cora?  But perhaps you don't hold with such old wife's tales?" 
[Line 537] She put him at his ease and assured him that she loved ancient fables
[Line 538] and liked to go on believing them, despite her better knowledge.
[Line 539]  "Just the same as me!" he cried eagerly.  "The very thing I do.  How
[Line 540] wonderful you should feel the same!  I know 'tis rubbish, yet I let it go sadly.  I'd believe in the pixies, if I could!" 
[Line 541] "Who was the Black Hunter, if you don't mind telling me?" she asked. "I'll sit here a bit afore I go on, if it won't be to hinder you." 
[Line 542] "Proud I am, I'm sure," he said.  "And as for him, the Black Hunter, that's no more than another name for the Devil himself.  'Twas thought that he'd come here by night with his great, bellowing, red-eyed dogs, and go forth to hunt souls.  A coal-black horse he rode; but sometimes
[Line 543] he'd set out afoot, for 'tis well remembered how once in the deep snow, on a winter morn, human footprints, along with hoofmarks, were traced to the top of the hill, but not down again!"
[Line 544]  "The devil flew away with somebody?" 
[Line 545] "So the old story says.  But I like the thought of the little Heath Hounds better.  For they hunt and harry old Nick's self.  They are the
[Line 546] spirits of the young children who die before they are baptised; and the
[Line 547] legend hath it that they win to heaven soon or late by hunting the Prince of Darkness.  'Tis the children that we bury with maimed rites
[Line 548] upon 'Chrisomers' Hill' in the churchyard.  They put that poor woman
[Line 549] who killed herself in the same place, because the old parson wouldn't read 'sure and certain hope' over her." 
[Line 550] But Cora was not interested in his conversation, though she pretended
[Line 551] to be.  She endeavoured to turn speech into a more personal road.  "What have you come here for?  I hadn't any idea you ever took walks alone." 
[Line 552] "I take hundreds--terrible poor hand at neighbouring with people, I am--like my father.  But I'm here to work--getting handles for tools. There's no wood for light tools like alder.  You know the old rhyme--
[Line 553]    'When aller's leaf is so big as a penny,   The stick will wear so tough as any.'  That's true enough, for I've proved it." 
[Line 554] "Set to work and I'll watch you, if I may."
[Line 555] "Proud, I'm sure.  And I'll see you home after.  But there's no haste.
[Line 556] I was thinking that bare, dark corner in the garden at Undershaugh
[Line 557] might do very nice for ferns--if you'd care----?"  "The very thing!  How kind to think of it.  I love the garden and the
[Line 558] flowers.  But none else cares about them.  D'you think you could get me
[Line 559] one of they king ferns?  But I suppose that would be too much to ask."
[Line 560] "I'll get you more than one." 
[Line 561] "I'll try to plant 'em then, but I'm not very clever." 
[Line 562] "I'll come and make a bit of a rockery myself, if--if you like."  "'Like!"  I should love it.  But 'tis very good of you to bother about
[Line 563] a stupid girl." 
[Line 564] "Don't you say that.  Far, far from stupid.  Never was a cleverer girl, I'm sure." 
[Line 565] She shook her head and talked about the ferns.  Then she became
[Line 566] personal.
[Line 567] "I've always felt somehow with you; but I suppose it ban't maidenly to
[Line 568] say such things--but I've always felt as you understood me, Mark."  "Ah!" he said.  "And as for me, I've felt--God, He knows what I've felt."
[Line 569]  The man broke off, and she smiled at him and dropped her eyes.  She
[Line 570] knew the thing that shared his heart with her, and now spoke of it.
[Line 571]  "And through you I've got to love tenor bell almost as much as you do.
[Line 572] Of a Sunday the day isn't complete till I've heard the beautiful note
[Line 573] of your bell and thought of you at the rope.  I always somehow think of
[Line 574] you when I hear that bell; and I think of the bell when I see you!
[Line 575] Ban't that strange?" 
[Line 576] "'Tis your wonderful quick mind, and you couldn't say anything to
[Line 577] please me better."
[Line 578]  "I wanted to ask you about the bells.  I'm so ignorant; but I thought,
[Line 579] if 'twasn't silly of me, I'd ask you about 'em.  I suppose they'm awful
[Line 580] difficult to ring?"
[Line 581] "Not a bit.  Only wants steady practice.  The whole business is little understood, but 'tis simple enough.  I've gone into it all from the beginning, and I'm glad--very glad--you care about it.  The first thing
[Line 582] is for a ring of bells to be in harmony with itself, and founders ought to be free to make 'em so.  The bells are never better than when they are broken out of the moulds, and every touch of the lathe, or chip of the chisel, is music lost.  The thickness of the sound-bow should be one-thirteenth of the diameter, you must know; but modern bells are
[Line 583] made for cheapness.  Long in the waist and high in the shoulder they
[Line 584] should be for true fineness of sound; but they cast 'em with short waists and flat shoulders now.  'Tis easier to hang and ring them so;
[Line 585] but they don't give the same music.  My tenor is a wonderful good bell--a maiden bell, as we say--one cast true, that has never had a chip at the sound-bow.  'I call the quick to church and dead to grave,' is her motto.  A Pennington bell she is, and no bell-founder ever cast a better.  Every year makes her sweeter, for there's nothing improves bell-metal like time."  "I suppose it wouldn't be possible for me actually to see the bells?" 
[Line 586] "It can be done and shall be," he promised.  Then he went off again.
[Line 587]  "I've been in nearly every bell-cot and bell-turret in Devonshire, one
[Line 588] time and another, and I've took a hand in change-ringing far and wide;
[Line 589] but our ring of six, for its size and weight, can't be beat in the
[Line 590] county, and there's no sweeter tenor that I've heard than mine.  And
[Line 591] I'm very hopeful that Mr. Masterman will take my advice and have our
[Line 592] wheels and gear looked to, and the bell-chamber cleaned out.  'Tis the
[Line 593] home of birds, and the nest litter lies feet deep up there.  The ladder's all rotten too.  We ought to have stays and slides; and our
[Line 594] ropes are a bit too heavy, and lack tuftings for the sally.  I'm hopeful he'll have a care for these things." 
[Line 595] He prattled on, for it was his subject and always loosed his tongue. She was bored to death, but from time to time, when he feared that he
[Line 596] wearied her, she assured him that her interest did not wane and was
[Line 597] only less than his own.  He showed unusual excitement at this meeting,
[Line 598] was lifted out of himself, and talked until grey gloaming sank over the valley and the jackdaws were silent.  Then Cora started up and declared that she must return home quickly.
[Line 599]  "Listening to you has made me forget all about the time and
[Line 600] everything," she said.  "They'll wonder whatever has befallen me."  "I'll see you home," he answered.  "'Tis my fault you'll be late, and I must take the blame."
[Line 601]  "And I've kept you from your work, I'm afraid." 
[Line 602] "That's no matter at all.  To-morrow will do just as well for the alder."  He rose and walked beside her.  She asked him to help her at one place
[Line 603] in the wood, and her cool, firm hand thrilled him.  Once or twice he thought to take this noble opportunity and utter the thing in his
[Line 604] heart; but he could not bring himself to do it.  Then, at her gate, he
[Line 605] left her, and they exchanged many assurances of mutual thanks and
[Line 606] obligation.  He promised to bring the ferns in three days' time, and undertook to spend an evening with the Linterns, build the rockery, and stay to supper with the family afterwards.
[Line 607] He walked home treading on air, with his mind full of hope and
[Line 608] happiness.  Cora had never been so close as on this day; she had never vouchsafed such an intimate glimpse of her beautiful spirit before.
[Line 609] Each word, each look seemed to bring her nearer; and yet, when he reflected on his own imperfections, a wave of doubt swept coldly over him.  He supped in silence, but, after the meal, he confessed the
[Line 610] thoughts in his mind.  "Never broke a twig this evening," he said.  "Was just going to begin, when who should come along but Cora Lintern." 
[Line 611] "Has she forgiven parson for turning her out of the choir?  Can't practise that side-glance at the men no more now."
[Line 612] "She's not that sort, father." 
[Line 613] "Not with a face like hers?  That girl would rather go hungry than
[Line 614] without admiration and flattering.  A little peacock, and so vain as one."  "You're wrong there.  I'll swear it.  She's very different to what you reckon.  Why, this very evening, there she was under the Water Stone all alone--walking along by herself just for love of the place.  Often
[Line 615] goes there, she tells me."
[Line 616] "Very surprised to find you there--eh?"
[Line 617] "That she was.  And somehow I got talking--such a silent man as me most times.  But I found myself chattering about the bells and one thing and another.  We've got a lot more in common than you might think."
[Line 618] Mr. Baskerville smoked and looked into the fire.
[Line 619] "Well, don't be in a hurry.  I'm not against marriage for the young
[Line 620] men.  But bide your time, till you've got more understanding of women."
[Line 621] "I'll never find another like her.  I'm sure she'd please you, father."
[Line 622]  "You'll be rich in a small way, as the world goes, presently. Remember, she knows that as well as you do." 
[Line 623] "She never speaks of money.  Just so simple and easily pleased as I am
[Line 624] myself, for that matter.  She loves natural things--just the things you
[Line 625] care about yourself." 
[Line 626] "And very much interested in tenor bell, no doubt?"
[Line 627] "How did you guess that?  But 'tis perfectly true.  She is; and she said a very kind thing that was very hopeful to me to hear.  She said
[Line 628] that the bell always put her in mind of me, and I always put her in mind of the bell."
[Line 629]  "I wonder!  And did you tell her what was writ on the bell?"  "Yes, I did, father."
[Line 630] "And d'you know what she thought?"  Mark shook his head.
[Line 631]  "She thought that the sooner it called you and her to church together, and the sooner it called me to my grave, the pleasanter life would look for her hard eyes."
[Line 632]  "Father!  'Tis cruel and unjust to say such things." 
[Line 633] "Haven't I seen her there o' Sundays ever since she growed up?  There's
[Line 634] nought tells you more about people than their ways in church.  As bright as a bee and smart and shining; but hard--hard as the nether
[Line 635] millstone, that woman's heart.  Have a care of her; that's all I'll say to you."  "I hope to God you'll know her better some day, father." 
[Line 636] "And I hope you will, my lad; and I'll use your strong words too, and
[Line 637] hope to God you'll know her better afore 'tis too late."  "This is cruel, and I'm bitter sorry to hear you say it," answered the young man, rising.  Then he went out and left his father alone.
[Line 638] Elsewhere Phyllis Lintern had eagerly inquired of Cora as to the
[Line 639] interview with the bellringer.
[Line 640] The girls shared many secrets and were close friends.  They knew unconsciously that their brother was more to the mother than were they. Heathman adored Mrs. Lintern and never wearied of showing it; but for
[Line 641] his sisters he cared little, and they felt no interest in him.
[Line 642]  Now Phyllis sympathised with Cora's ambitions and romances.
[Line 643]  "How was it?" she asked.  "I warrant you brought him to the scratch!"
[Line 644]  "'Tis all right," declared her sister.  "'Tis so good as done.  The word was on his tongue coming up-along in the dimpsy; but it stuck in
[Line 645] his throat.  I know the signs well enough.  However, 'twill slip out pretty soon, I reckon.  He's a good sort, though fidgety, but he's
[Line 646] gotten lovely eyes.  I'll wake him up and smarten him up,
[Line 647] too--presently."
[Line 648]   CHAPTER VII
[Line 649] When man builds a house on Dartmoor, he plants trees to protect it.
[Line 650] Sometimes they perish; sometimes they endure to shield his dwelling
[Line 651] from the riotous and seldom-sleeping winds.  Round the abode of
[Line 652] Humphrey Baskerville stood beech and pine.  A solid old house lurked beneath, like a bear in its grove.  People likened its face to the
[Line 653] master's--the grey, worn, tar-pitched roof to his hair, and the small
[Line 654] windows on either side of the door to his eyes.  A few apple trees were in the garden, and currant and gooseberry bushes prospered indifferent
[Line 655] well beneath them.  Rhubarb and a row of elders also flourished here.
[Line 656] The latter were permitted to exist for their fruit, and of the berries Mrs. Susan Hacker, Humphrey's widowed housekeeper, made medicinal preparations supposed to possess value.  Hawk House lay under a tor, and behind it the land towered to a stony waste that culminated in wild masses of piled granite, where the rowan
[Line 657] grew and the vixen laid her cubs.  From this spot one might take a bird's-eye survey of Humphrey Baskerville's domain.  Gold lichens had fastened on the roof, and the folk conceited that since there was no more room in the old man's house for his money, it began to ooze out
[Line 658] through the tiles. 
[Line 659] Humphrey himself now sat on a favourite stone aloft and surveyed his
[Line 660] possessions and the scene around them.  It was his custom in fair weather to spend many hours sequestered upon the tor.  Dwarf oaks grew in the clitters, and he marked the passage of the time by their
[Line 661] activity, by the coming of migrant birds, by the appearance of the infant foxes and by other natural signs and tokens.  Beneath Hawk House there subtended a great furze-clad space flanked with woods.  The Rut, as it was called, fell away to farms and fertile fields, and terminated
[Line 662] in a glen through which the little Torry river passed upon her way to Plym.  Cann Wood fringed the neighbouring heights, and far away to the
[Line 663] south Laira's lake extended and Plymouth appeared--faint, grey,
[Line 664] glittering under a gauze of smoke. 
[Line 665] The tor itself was loved by hawks and stoats, crows and foxes.  Not a few people, familiar with the fact that Humphrey here took his solitary
[Line 666] walks and kept long vigils, would affirm that he held a sort of
[Line 667] converse with these predatory things and learned from them their winged and four-footed cunning.  His sympathy, indeed, was with fox and hawk rather than with hunter and hound.  He admitted it, but in no sense of companionship with craft did he interest himself in the wild creatures.
[Line 668] He made no fatuous imputation of cruelty to the hawk, or cunning to the fox.  His bent of mind, none the less, inclined him to admire their
[Line 669] singlehanded fight for life against long odds; and thus he, too, fell
[Line 670] into fallacy; but his opinion took a practical turn and was not swiftly
[Line 671] shattered, as such emotions are apt to be, when the pitied outlaw
[Line 672] offers to the sentimental spectator a personal taste of his quality.
[Line 673]  If a hawk stooped above his chickens, he felt a sort of contempt for
[Line 674] the screaming, flying fowls--let the hawk help itself if it could--and
[Line 675] did not run for his gun.  Indeed, he had no gun.  As men said of this or that obstinate ancient that he had never travelled in a train, so they affirmed, concerning Humphrey Baskerville, that he had never in his life fired a gun.
[Line 676] He sat and smoked a wooden pipe and reflected on the puzzles of his days.  He knew that he was held in little esteem, but that had never
[Line 677] troubled him.  His inquiring spirit rose above his fellow-creatures; and he prided himself upon the fact, and did not see that just in this particular of a flight too lofty did he fail of the landmarks and sure
[Line 678] ground he sought.
[Line 679] A discontent, in substance very distinguished and noble, imbued his consciousness.  He was still seeking solace out of life and a way that
[Line 680] should lead to rest.  But he could not find it.  He was in arms on the wrong road.  He missed the fundamental fact that from humanity and
[Line 681] service arise not only the first duties of life, but also the highest rewards that life can offer.  He had little desire towards his fellow-creatures.  His mind appeared to magnify their deficiencies and
[Line 682] weakness.  He was ungenerous in his interpretation of motives.  Mankind
[Line 683] awoke his highest impatience.  He sneered at his own shortcomings
[Line 684] daily, and had no more mercy for the manifold disabilities of human nature in general.  In the light of his religion and his learning, he
[Line 685] conceived that man should be by many degrees a nobler and a wiser thing
[Line 686] than he found him; and this conclusion awoke impatience and a fiery
[Line 687] aversion.  He groped therefore in a blind alley, for as yet service of man had not brought its revelation to his spirit, or opened the portals
[Line 688] of content.  He failed to perceive that the man who lives rationally
[Line 689] for men, with all thereby involved in his duty to himself, is
[Line 690] justifying his own existence to the limit of human capacity.
[Line 691] Instead, he fulfilled obligations to his particular God with all his might, and supposed this rule of conduct embraced every necessity.  He
[Line 692] despised his neighbour, but he despised himself also.  Thus he was
[Line 693] logical, but such a rule of conduct left him lonely.  Hence it came
[Line 694] about that darkness clothed him like a garment, and that his kind
[Line 695] shunned him, and cared not to consider him.
[Line 696]  He sat silent and motionless.  His gift of stillness had often won some little intimate glimpse of Nature, and it did so now.  A fox went by
[Line 697] him at close quarters.  It passed absorbed in its own affairs,
[Line 698] incautious and without fear.  Then suddenly it saw him, braced its
[Line 699] muscles and slipped away like a streak of cinnamon light through the stones.  It made for the dwarf oaks beneath the head of the tor, and the watcher saw its red stern rise and its white-tipped brush jerk this way and
[Line 700] that as it leapt from boulder to boulder.  A big and powerful fox--so Humphrey perceived; one that had doubtless stood before hounds in his
[Line 701] time, and would again. 
[Line 702] Arrived at the confines of the wood, the brute hurried himself no more; but rested awhile and, with a sort of highwayman insolence, surveyed
[Line 703] the object of alarm.  Then it disappeared, and the man smiled to himself and was glad that he had seen this particular neighbour.
[Line 704]  At the poultry-house far below, moved Mrs. Hacker.  Viewed from this elevation she presented nothing but a sun-bonnet and a great white square of apron.  She wore black, and her bust disappeared seen thus far away, though her capacious person might be noted at a mile.  Susan Hacker was florid, taciturn, and staunch to her master.  If she had a
[Line 705] hero, it was Mr. Baskerville; and if she had an antipathy, Miss Eliza Gollop stood for that repugnance.
[Line 706]  Of Susan it might be said that she was honest and not honest.  In her
[Line 707] case, though, she would have scorned to take a crust; she listened at doors.  To steal a spoon was beyond her power; but to steal information
[Line 708] not intended for her ears did not outrage her moral sense.  Her rare triumphs were concerned with Humphrey's ragged wardrobe; and when she could prevail with him to buy a new suit of clothes, or burn an old one, she felt the day had justified itself.  Now, through the clitters beneath him, there ascended a man, and
[Line 709] Humphrey prepared to meet his nephew.  He had marked Rupert speak with
[Line 710] Mrs. Hacker and seen her point to the tor.  It pleased the uncle that this youth should sometimes call unasked upon him, for he rated Rupert
[Line 711] as the sanest and usefulest of his kindred.  In a sense Rupert pleased Humphrey better than his own son did.  A vague instinct to poetry and
[Line 712] sentiment and things of abstract beauty, which belonged as an
[Line 713] ingredient to Mark's character, found no echo in his father's breast. 
[Line 714] "I be come to eat my dinner along with you and fetch a message for
[Line 715] Mark," began the young man.  "Mr. Masterman's meeting, to tell everybody about the play, will be held in the parish room early next month, and parson specially wants you and Mark to be there.  There's an
[Line 716] idea of reviving some old-fangled customs.  I dare say 'tis a very good idea, and there will be plenty to lend a hand; but I doubt whether Mark will dress up and spout poetry for him--any more than I would." 
[Line 717] "He means to perform 'St. George' next Christmas and invite the
[Line 718] countryside," said Mr. Baskerville.  "Well, one man's meat is another man's poison.  He's young and energetic.  He'll carry it through somehow with such material as lies about him.  The maidens will all
[Line 719] want to be in it, no doubt." 
[Line 720] "I think 'tis foolery, uncle." 
[Line 721] "You think wrong, then.  Ban't always foolery to hark back to old ways. He's got his ideas for waking the people up.  You and me might say, 'don't wake 'em up'; but 'tisn't our business.  It is his business, as
[Line 722] a minister, to open their eyes and polish their senses.  So let him try with childish things first--not that he'll succeed, for he won't."  "Then what's the good of trying?" 
[Line 723] "The man must earn his money."  "Fancy coming to a dead-alive hole like this!  Why, even Jack Head from
[Line 724] Trowlesworthy--him as works for Mr. Luscombe--even he laughs at Shaugh." 
[Line 725] "He's a rare Radical, is Head.  'Tis the likes of him the upper people don't want to teach to read or to think--for fear of pickling a rod for
[Line 726] themselves.  But Head will be thinking.  He's made so.  I like him."
[Line 727] "He laughed at me for one," said Rupert; "and though I laughed back, I smarted under his tongue.  He says for a young and strapping chap like me to stop at Cadworthy doing labourer's work for my father, be a poor-spirited and even a shameful thing.  He says I ought to blush to follow a plough or move muck, with the learning I've learnt.  Of
[Line 728] course, 'tis a small, mean life, in a manner of speaking, for a man of energy as loves work like I do."
[Line 729] Mr. Baskerville scratched his head with the mouthpiece of his pipe, and surveyed Rupert for some time without speaking.
[Line 730] Then he rose, sniffed the air, and buttoned up his coat.
[Line 731]  "We'll walk a bit and I'll show you something," he said.  They set out over Shaugh Moor and Rupert proceeded.
[Line 732] "I do feel rather down on my luck, somehow--especially about Milly Luscombe.  It don't seem right or fair exactly--as if Providence wasn't
[Line 733] on my side."
[Line 734] "Don't bleat that nonsensical stuff," said his uncle.  "You're the sort that cry out to Providence if you fall into a bed of nettles--instead
[Line 735] of getting up quick and looking for a dock-leaf.  Time to cry to Providence when you're in a fix you can't get out of single-handed.  If
[Line 736] you begin at your time of life, and all about nothing too, belike 'twill come to be like the cry of 'Wolf, wolf!' and then, when you
[Line 737] really do get into trouble and holloa out, Providence won't heed."
[Line 738] "Milly Luscombe's not a small thing, anyway.  How can I go on digging
[Line 739] and delving while father withstands me and won't hear a word about her?"
[Line 740] "She's too good for you." 
[Line 741] "I know it; but she don't think so, thank the Lord."
[Line 742]  "Your father's a man that moves in a groove.  Maybe you go safer that
[Line 743] way; but not further.  The beaten track be his motto.  He married late in life, and it worked very well; so it follows to his narrow mind that
[Line 744] late in life is the right and only time to marry."
[Line 745]  "I wish you'd tell him that you hold with Milly and think a lot of her.
[Line 746] Father has a great opinion of your cleverness, I'm sure." 
[Line 747] "Not he!  'Tis your uncle Nathan that he sets store by.  Quite natural that he should.  He's a much cleverer man than me, and knows a lot more
[Line 748] about human nature.  See how well all folk speak of him.  Can't you get him your side?  Your father would soon give ear to you if Uncle Nathan
[Line 749] approved."  "'Tis an idea.  And Uncle Nat certainly be kind always.  I might try
[Line 750] and get him to do something.  He's very friendly with Mr. Saul Luscombe, Milly's uncle."
[Line 751]  "How does Luscombe view it?" 
[Line 752] "He'll be glad to have Milly off his hands."  "More fool him then.  For there's no more understanding girl about."  "So Jack Head says.  Ban't often he's got a good word for anybody; but he's told me, in so many words, that Milly be bang out of the common.
[Line 753] He said it because his savage opinions never fluster her."  They stood on Hawk Tor, and beneath them stretched, first, the carpet
[Line 754] of the heath.  Then the ground fell into a valley, where water meadows
[Line 755] spread about a stream, and beyond, by woods and homesteads, the earth ascended again to Shaugh Prior.  The village, perched upon the apex of the hill, twinkled like a jewel.  Glitter of whitewash and rosy-wash
[Line 756] shone under the grey roofs; sunlight and foliage sparkled and intermingled round the church tower; light roamed upon the hills, revealing and obscuring detail in its passage.  To the far west, above
[Line 757] deep valleys, the world appeared again; but now it had receded and
[Line 758] faded and merged in tender blue to the horizon.  Earth spread before the men in three huge and simple planes: of heath and stone sloping
[Line 759] from north to south; of hillside and village and hamlet perched upon their proper crest; of the dim, dreaming distance swept with the haze of summer and rising to sky-line.
[Line 760] "That's not small--that's big," said Humphrey Baskerville.  "Plenty of
[Line 761] room here for the best or worse that one boy can do."  But Rupert doubted.  "Think of the world out of sight, uncle.  This bit spread here be
[Line 762] little more than a picture in its frame."
[Line 763]  "Granted; but the frame's wide enough to cage all that your wits will ever work.  You can run here and wear your fingers to the bone without
[Line 764] bruising yourself against any bars.  Go down in the churchyard and take a look at the Baskerville slates--fifty of 'em if there's one: your
[Line 765] grandfather, your great-uncle, the musicker, and all the rest.  And
[Line 766] every man and woman of the lot lived and died, and suffered and sweated, and did good or evil within this picture-frame."
[Line 767]  "All save the richest--him that went to foreign parts and made a fortune and sent back tons of money to father and you and Uncle Nat."  Humphrey laughed.
[Line 768] "Thou hast me there!" he said.  "But don't be discontented.  Bide a bit
[Line 769] and see how the wind blows.  I'm not against a man following the spirit
[Line 770] that calls him; but wait and find out whether 'tis a true voice or only a lying echo.  What does Milly say?"  "'Tis Milly have put the thought into me, for that matter.  She's
[Line 771] terrible large in her opinions.  She holds that father haven't got no right to refuse to let us be tokened.  She'd come and talk to him, if I'd let her.  A regular fear-nothing, she is."
[Line 772]  "What would she have you do?"  "Gird up and be off.  She comes of a very wandering family, and, of course, one must allow for that.  I've nought to say against it.  But
[Line 773] they can't bide in one spot long.  Something calls 'em to be roaming."  "The tribe of Esau." 
[Line 774] They talked on, and Rupert found himself the better for some caustic
[Line 775] but sane counsel.
[Line 776] "'Tis no good asking impossibilities from you, and I'm the last to do it," said Humphrey.  "There are some things we can't escape from, and our characters are one of them.  There's no more sense in trying to run
[Line 777] from your character than in trying to run from your shadow.  Too often your character is your shadow, come to think on it; and cruel black at
[Line 778] that.  But don't be impatient.  Wait and watch yourself as well as other people.  If these thoughts have been put in your head by the girl, they may not be natural to you, and they may not be digested by you.  See how your own character takes 'em.  I'm not against courting, mind, nor against early marriages; and if this woman be made of the
[Line 779] stuff to mix well and close with your own character, then marry her and
[Line 780] defy the devil and all his angels to harm you.  To take such a woman is
[Line 781] the best day's work that even the hardest working man can do in this
[Line 782] world.  But meantime don't whine, but go ahead and gather wisdom and learn a little about the things that happen outside the
[Line 783] picture-frame--as I do." 
[Line 784] They turned presently and went back to dinner.  Rupert praised his uncle, and declared that life looked the easier for his advice.
[Line 785]  "'Tis no good being called 'The Hawk' if you can't sharpen your wits as well as your claws," said the old man.  "Yes--you're astonished--but I know what they call me well enough."  "I knocked a chap down last Sunday on Cadworthy bridge for saying it,"
[Line 786] declared Rupert.  "Very thoughtful and very proper to stand up for your family; but I'm not hurt.  Maybe there's truth in it.  I've no quarrel with the
[Line 787] hawks--or the herons either--for all they do eat the trout.  By all
[Line 788] accounts there was birds to eat trout afore there was men to eat 'em.
[Line 789] We humans have invented a saying that possession is nine points of the law; but we never thought much of that when it comed to knocking our
[Line 790] weaker neighbours on the head--whether they be birds or men."
[Line 791]  "You've made me a lot more contented with the outlook, anyway." 
[Line 792] "I'm glad to hear it.  Content's the one thing I'd wish you--and wish
[Line 793] myself.  I can't see the way very clear yet.  Let me know if ever you come by it."
[Line 794]  "You!  Why, you'm the most contented of any of us."  "Come and eat, and don't talk of what you know nought," said Mr.
[Line 795] Baskerville.
[Line 796]  They went through the back yard of the homestead presently, where a
[Line 797] hot, distinctive odour of pigs saturated the air.  As they passed by,
[Line 798] some young, very dirty, pink porkers grunted with fat, amiable voices
[Line 799] and cuddled to their lean mother, where she lay in a lair of ordure.  "That's content," explained Humphrey; "it belongs to brainless things,
[Line 800] and only to them.  I haven't found it among men and women yet, and I
[Line 801] never count to.  Rainbow gold in this world.  Yet, don't mistake me, I'm seeking after it still."  "Why seek for it, if there's no such thing, uncle?"
[Line 802] "Well may you ask that.  But the answer's easy.  Because 'tis part of
[Line 803] my character to seek for it, Rupert.  Character be stronger than
[Line 804] reason's self, if you can understand that.  I seek because I'm driven."  "You might find it after all, uncle.  There must be such a thing--else
[Line 805] there'd be no word for it."
[Line 806] The older sighed.
[Line 807]  "A young and hopeful fashion of thought," he said.  "But you're out
[Line 808] there.  Men have made up words for many a fine, fancied thing their
[Line 809] hearts long for; but the word is all--stillborn out of poor human hope."  He brooded deep into his own soul upon this thought and spoke little more that day.  But Mark was waiting for his dinner when they returned, and he and Rupert found themes in common to occupy them through the meal.  The great project of the new vicar chiefly supplied conversation.
[Line 810] Rupert felt indifferent, but Mark was much interested.
[Line 811] "I'm very willing to lend a hand all I can, and I expect the parish
[Line 812] will support it," he said.  "But as for play-acting myself, and taking a part, I wouldn't for all the world.  It beats me how anybody can get
[Line 813] up on a platform and speak a speech afore his fellow-creatures assembled."  "The girls will like it," foretold Rupert.  "Cora Lintern is to play a part," declared Mark; "and no doubt she'll do it amazing well."  Rupert was up in arms at once.
[Line 814] "I should think they'll ask Milly Luscombe too.  She's got more wits
[Line 815] than any of 'em."  "She may have as much as Cora, but not more, I can assure you of that,"
[Line 816] answered Mark firmly. 
[Line 817] He rarely contradicted a statement or opposed an assertion; but upon this great subject his courage was colossal.  
[Line 818]  
[Line 819] CHAPTER VIII 
[Line 820] Mr. Masterman and his sister made more friends than enemies.  The man's
[Line 821] good-nature and energy attracted his parishioners; while Miss
[Line 822] Masterman, though not genial, was sincere.  A certain number followed the party of Mr. Gollop and Eliza, yet, as time passed, it diminished. The surplices arrived; the girls were turned out of the choir; but the
[Line 823] heavens did not fall.  Even the Nonconformists of Shaugh Prior regarded the young vicar with friendliness, and when he called a meeting at the parish room, Mr. Nathan Baskerville and others who stood for dissent,
[Line 824] attended it in an amiable spirit.
[Line 825] Rumours as to the nature of the proposition had leaked out, and they
[Line 826] were vague; but a very general interest had been excited, and when the evening came the vicar, his churchwardens, and friends, found a considerable company assembled.
[Line 827] There were present Vivian and Nathan Baskerville, with most of the former's family.  Mrs. Lintern and her two daughters from Undershaugh also came; while Heathman Lintern, Ned Baskerville, and other young men stood in a group at the rear of the company.  From Trowlesworthy arrived the warrener, Saul Luscombe, his niece, Milly, and his man,
[Line 828] Jack Head.  People looked uneasy at sight of the last, for he was a
[Line 829] revolutionary and firebrand.  The folk suspected that he held
[Line 830] socialistic views, and were certain that he worked harm on the morals
[Line 831] of younger people.  Susan Hacker, at her master's wish, attended the meeting and sat impassive among friends.  Thomas Gollop and Joe Voysey,
[Line 832] the vicarage gardener, sat together; but Miss Gollop was not present, because her services were occupied with the newly-born.
[Line 833]  A buzz and babel filled the chamber and the heat increased.  Jack Head
[Line 834] opened a window.  Whereupon Mr. Gollop rose and shut it again.  The
[Line 835] action typified that eternal battle of principle which waged between them.  But Vivian Baskerville was on the side of fresh air.  "Let be!" he shouted.  "Us don't want to be roasted alive, Thomas!"
[Line 836] So the window was opened once more, and Head triumphed.
[Line 837]  Dennis Masterman swiftly explained his desire and invited the parish to support him in reviving an ancient and obsolete ceremonial.
[Line 838]  "The oldest men among you must remember the days of the Christmas
[Line 839] mummers," he said.  "I've heard all about them from eye-witnesses, and it strikes me that to get up the famous play of 'St. George,' with the
[Line 840] quaint old-world dialogue, would give us all something to do this winter, and be very interesting and instructive, and capital fun. There are plenty among you who could act the parts splendidly, and as the original version is rather short and barren, I should have some
[Line 841] choruses written in, and go through it and polish it up, and perhaps
[Line 842] even add a character or two.  In the old days it was all done by the lads, but why not have some lasses in it as well?  However, these are
[Line 843] minor points to be decided later.  Would you like the play? that's the
[Line 844] first question.  It is a revival of an ancient custom.  It will
[Line 845] interest a great many people outside our parish; and if it is to be
[Line 846] done at all, it must be done really well.  Probably some will be for it and some against.  For my part, I only want to please the greater
[Line 847] number.  Those who are for it had better elect a spokesman, and let him
[Line 848] say a word first; then we'll hear those who are against."
[Line 849]  The people listened quietly; then they bent this way and that, and discussed the suggestion.  Some rose and approached Vivian Baskerville,
[Line 850] where he sat beside his brother.  After some minutes of buzzing
[Line 851] conversation, during which Vivian shook his head vigorously, and Nathan
[Line 852] as vigorously nodded, the latter rose with reluctance, and the folk
[Line 853] stamped their feet.  "'Tis only because of my brother's modest nature that I get up," he explained.  "As a Church of England man and a leader among us, they very properly wanted for him to speak.  But he won't do it, and no more will young Farmer Waite, and no more will Mr. Luscombe of Trowlesworthy; so I'll voice 'em to the best of my power.  Though I'm of t'other branch of the Christian Church, yet my friends will bear me out that I've nothing but kind feeling and regard for all of them, and
[Line 854] in such a pleasant matter as this I shall do all in my power to help your reverence, as we all shall.  For I do think there's none but will make the mummers welcome again, and lend a hand to lift the fun into a
[Line 855] great success.  Me and my brother and Luscombe, and Waite and Gollop, and Joe Voysey, and a good few more, can well remember the old mumming
[Line 856] days; and we'll all do our best to rub up our memories.  So what we all
[Line 857] say is, 'Go ahead, Mr. Masterman, and good luck to it!'"
[Line 858]  Applause greeted Nathan.  The folk were filled with admiration at his
[Line 859] ready turn of speech.  He sat down again between Mrs. Lintern and Cora. Everybody clapped their hands.  Then came a hiss from the corner where Jack Head stood.  "A dissentient voice," declared the clergyman.  "Who is that?"
[Line 860]  "My name is Jack Head, and I be gwaine to offer objections," said the man stoutly. 
[Line 861] "Better save your wind then!" snapped Mr. Gollop.  "You be one against the meeting."
[Line 862]  Head was a middle-aged, narrow-browed, and underhung individual of an iron-grey colour.  His body was long and thin; his shoulders were high;
[Line 863] his expression aggressive, yet humorous.  He had swift wits and a narrow understanding.  He was observant and impressed with the misery
[Line 864] of the world; but he possessed no philosophical formulas to balance his
[Line 865] observation or counsel patience before the welter of life.  He was
[Line 866] honest, but scarce knew the meaning of amenity.
[Line 867] "One or not won't shut my mouth," he said.  "I'm a member of the parish so much as you, though I don't bleat a lot of wild nonsense come every
[Line 868] seventh day, and I say that to spend good time and waste good money this way be a disgrace, and a going back instead of going forward.
[Line 869] What for do we want to stir up a lot of silly dead foolishness that our
[Line 870] grandfathers invented?  Ban't there nothing better to do with ourselves
[Line 871] and our wits than dress up like a ship-load of monkeys and go
[Line 872] play-acting?  We might so well start to wassail the apple-trees and put
[Line 873] mourning on the bee-butts when a man dies.  I'm against it, and I
[Line 874] propose instead that Mr. Masterman looks round him and sees what a
[Line 875] miserable Jakes of a mess his parish be in, and spends his time trying to get the landlords to----"  "Order!  Order!  Withdraw that!" cried out Mr. Gollop furiously.  "How
[Line 876] dare this infidel man up and say the parish be in a Jakes of a mess? Where's Ben North?"
[Line 877] "I'm here, Thomas," said a policeman, who stood at the door.
[Line 878]  "You'm a silly old mumphead," replied Jack.  "To hear you about this parish--God's truth!  I'll tell you this, my brave hero.  When the
[Line 879] devil was showing the Lord the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of 'em, he kept his thumb on Shaugh Prior, so as none should see what a
[Line 880] dung-heap of a place it was."
[Line 881] "Order!  Order!" cried Miss Masterman shrilly, and Mr. Gollop grew
[Line 882] livid.
[Line 883]  "I appeal to the chair!  I appeal to the nation!" he gasped.  Then he shook his fist at Jack.
[Line 884] "There's no chair--not yet," explained Dennis.  "As soon as we decide, I'll take the chair, and we'll appoint a committee to go into the
[Line 885] matter and arrange the parts, and so on.  The first thing is, are we agreed?" 
[Line 886] One loud shout attested to the sense of the meeting.  "Then, Mr. Head, you're in a minority of one, and I hope we may yet convince you that this innocent revival is not a bad thing," said Dennis.  "And further than that, you mustn't run down Shaugh Prior in
[Line 887] this company.  We've got a cheerful conceit of ourselves, and why not?
[Line 888] Don't think I'm dead to the dark side of human life, and the sorrows
[Line 889] and sufferings of the poor.  I hope you'll all very soon find that I'm not that sort, or my sister either.  And the devil himself can't hide
[Line 890] Shaugh Prior from the Lord and Saviour of us all, Mr. Head--have no
[Line 891] fear of that."
[Line 892]  "Sit down, Jack, and say you'm sorry," cried Mr. Luscombe.  "Not me," replied Head.  "I've stated my views at a free meeting, and
[Line 893] I'm on the losing side, like men of my opinions always be where parsons
[Line 894] have a voice.  But me and my friends will be up top presently."  "Turn him out, Ben North!" shouted Mr. Gollop; but Ben North refused.
[Line 895] Indeed, he was of Jack's party. 
[Line 896] "He've done nought but say his say, and I shan't turn him out," the
[Line 897] policeman answered.  "There's nobody in the chair yet, and therefore
[Line 898] there's none here with power to command the Law to move."
[Line 899] A committee was swiftly formed.  It consisted of the clergyman and certain parishioners.  Nathan joined it for his family; Mr. Luscombe
[Line 900] also joined, and Dennis promised that certain local antiquaries and the lord of the manor would assist the enterprise. 
[Line 901] "While we are here," he said, "we may as well get the thing well
[Line 902] advanced and decide about the characters.  All those interested are
[Line 903] here, so why not let me read through the old play as it stands?  Then
[Line 904] we'll settle the parts, and each can copy his or her part in turn."
[Line 905] "There's nothing like being fore-handed," admitted Nathan.  "Let's have
[Line 906] it by all means.  We shall want young and old to play, if my memory
[Line 907] serves me." 
[Line 908] "We shall, and a good company to sing the songs that I hope to add.  My
[Line 909] sister, our organist, will undertake the music." 
[Line 910] "And right well she'll do it, without a doubt," declared Nathan.  "On
[Line 911] all hands 'tis admitted how the church music has mended a lot since she
[Line 912] took it up." 
[Line 913] Mr. Masterman then read a version of the old play, and its ingenuous
[Line 914] humour woke laughter.
[Line 915]  "Now," said the vicar when his recital was at an end, "I'll ask those among us who will volunteer to act--ladies and gentlemen--to come forward.  Especially I appeal to the ladies.  They'll have to say very
[Line 916] little."
[Line 917]  "Only to look nice, and I'm sure that won't cost 'em an effort, for they can't help it," declared Nathan.
[Line 918] None immediately rose.  Then Ned Baskerville strolled down the room.
[Line 919]  "Best-looking young man in Shaugh," cried an anonymous voice.
[Line 920]  "And the laziest!" answered another unknown. 
[Line 921] There was a laugh and Ned turned ruddy.  "Thou'lt never take trouble enough to learn thy part, Ned!" cried
[Line 922] Heathman Lintern.  "Play Turkish knight, my son," said his father.  "Then thou can'st be knocked on the head and die comfortable without more trouble."
[Line 923]  Others followed Ned, and Mr. Masterman called for Mark.  "You'll not desert us, Mark?  I shall want your help, I know." 
[Line 924] "And glad to give it," answered the young man.  He grew very hot and
[Line 925] nervous to find himself named.  His voice broke, he coughed and cut a
[Line 926] poor figure.  Somebody patted him on the back. 
[Line 927] "Don't be frighted, Mark," said Vivian Baskerville; "his reverence only wants for you to do what you can.  He wouldn't ask impossibilities." 
[Line 928] Mrs. Baskerville compared her handsome son to stammering Mark and felt satisfied.  Cora Lintern also contrasted the young men, and in her
[Line 929] bosom was anything but satisfaction.
[Line 930]  "You needn't act, but you must help in many ways.  You're so well up in
[Line 931] the old lore--all about our legends and customs," explained the
[Line 932] clergyman.  "We count on you.  And now we want some of the older men among you, and when we've settled them we must come to the ladies. We're getting on splendidly.  Now--come--you set a good example, Thomas." 
[Line 933] "Me!" cried Mr. Gollop.  "Me to play-act!  Whoever heard the like?"  "You must play, Thomas," urged Vivian Baskerville of Cadworthy.  "Such
[Line 934] a voice can't be lost.  What a King of Egypt the man will make!"  "I'll do a part if you will, but not else," returned Gollop, and the
[Line 935] Baskerville family lifted a laugh at their father's expense.
[Line 936]  "For that matter I've took the stage often enough," admitted Vivian;
[Line 937] "but 'twas to work, not to talk.  All the same, if his reverence would
[Line 938] like for me to play a part, why, I'm ready and willing, so long as
[Line 939] there isn't much to say to it." 
[Line 940] "Hurrah for Mr. Baskerville!" shouted several present.  "And Mr. Nathan must play, too," declared Joe Voysey.  "No revel would be complete without him." 
[Line 941] "If you'll listen I'll tell you what I think," said the clergyman. "I've considered your parts during the last five minutes, and they go
[Line 942] like this in my mind.  Let's take them in order:-- 
[Line 943] "St. George, Mr. Ned Baskerville.  Will you do St. George, Ned?"
[Line 944]  "Yes, if you can't find a better," said the young man.  "Good!  Now the Turkish knight comes next.  He must be young and a bit of a fighter.  Will you be Turkish knight, Mr. Waite?" 
[Line 945] He addressed a young, good-looking, dark man, who farmed land in the parish, and dwelt a few miles off.
[Line 946]  Mr. Waite laughed and nodded.
[Line 947]  "Right--I'll try."
[Line 948]  "Well done!  Now"--Mr. Masterman smiled and looked at Jack Head--"will
[Line 949] Mr. Head play the Bear--to oblige us all?"  Everybody laughed, including Jack himself.  "The very living man for Bear!" cried Mr. Luscombe.  "I command you, Jack, to be Bear!"
[Line 950]  "You ain't got much to do but growl and fight, Jack, and you're a oner at both," said Heathman.  "Well, I've said my say," returned Mr. Head, "and I was in a minority. But since this parish wants for me to be Bear, I'll Bear it out so well as I can; and if I give St. George a bit of a hug afore he bowls me
[Line 951] over, he mustn't mind that." 
[Line 952] "Capital!  Thank you, Jack Head.  Now, who'll be Father Christmas?  I
[Line 953] vote for Mr. Nathan Baskerville."  Applause greeted the suggestion, but Miss Masterman bent over from her seat and whispered to her brother.  He shook his head, however, and answered under his breath.
[Line 954]  "It doesn't matter a button about his being a dissenter.  So much the
[Line 955] better.  Let's draw them in all we can."  "You ought to choose the church people first."  "It's done now, anyway," he replied.  "Everybody likes the man.  We must have him in it, or half the folk won't come." 
[Line 956] "The King of Egypt is next," said Nathan, after he had been duly
[Line 957] elected to Father Christmas.  "I say Thomas Gollop here for the part."  "I don't play nought," answered Thomas firmly, "unless Vivian Baskerville do.  He's promised."
[Line 958]  "I'll be Giant, then, and say 'Fee-fo-fum!" answered the farmer. "'Twill be a terrible come-along-of-it for Ned here, and I warn him that if he don't fight properly valiant, I won't die."
[Line 959] "The very man--the only man for Giant," declared Dennis Masterman.  "So
[Line 960] that's settled.  Now, who's for Doctor?  That's a very important part.
[Line 961] I suppose your father wouldn't do it, Mark?  He's just the wise-looking face for a doctor."
[Line 962]  "My brother!" cried Vivian.  "Good Lord!  he'd so soon stand on his head in the market-place as lend a hand in a bit of nonsense like this.
[Line 963] Ask Luscombe here.  Will you be Doctor, Saul?"
[Line 964] But Mr. Luscombe refused.  "Not in my line.  Here's Joe Voysey--he's doctored a lot of things in his time--haven't you, Joe?"
[Line 965] "Will you be Doctor, Joe?" asked Mr. Masterman.  But Joe refused.
[Line 966]  "Too much to say," he answered.  "I might larn it with a bit of sweat, but I should never call it home when the time came." 
[Line 967] "Be the French Eagle, Joe," suggested Mark Baskerville.  "You've got but little to say, and St. George soon settles you."
[Line 968]  "And the very living nose for it, Joe," urged Mr. Gollop.  "Very well, if the meeting is for it, I'll be Eagle," assented Mr. Voysey. 
[Line 969] The part of Doctor remained unfilled for the present.
[Line 970]  "Now there's the fair Princess Sabra and Mother Dorothy," explained the
[Line 971] vicar.  "Princess Sabra, the King of Egypt's daughter, will be a
[Line 972] novelty, for she didn't come into the old play in person.  She doesn't
[Line 973] say anything, but she must be there."
[Line 974] "Miss Lintern for Princess Sabra!" said Mark.
[Line 975]  Everybody laughed, and the young man came in for some chaff; but Dennis
[Line 976] approved, and Mrs. Lintern nodded and smiled.  Cora blushed and Nathan
[Line 977] patted Mark on the back. 
[Line 978] "A good idea, and we're all for it," he said.
[Line 979] To Cora, as the belle of the village, belonged the part by right.  She was surprised and gratified at this sudden access of importance.
[Line 980] Then the vicar prepared to close his meeting.  "For Mother Dorothy we want a lady of mature years and experience.  The
[Line 981] part is often played by a man, but I would sooner a lady played it, if we can persuade one to do so," he said.  "Mrs. Hacker!  Mrs. Hacker!" shouted a mischievous young man at the back of the hall.
[Line 982] "Never," said Susan Hacker calmly.  "Not that I'd mind; but whatever
[Line 983] would my master say?"
[Line 984]  "Let my sister play the part," suggested Thomas.  "Eliza Gollop fears
[Line 985] nought on two legs.  She'll go bravely through with it."  Mr. Nathan's heart sank, but he could not object. 
[Line 986] The company was divided.  Then, to the surprise of not a few, Mrs. Hacker spoke again.  The hated name had dispelled her doubts.  "I'll do it, and chance master," she said.  "Yes, there's no false shame in me, I believe.  I'll do it rather than----"
[Line 987]  "You're made for the part, ma'am," declared Mr. Nathan, much relieved. "And very fine you'll look.  You've got to kiss Father Christmas at the end of the play, though.  I hope you don't mind that."
[Line 988] "That's why she's going to act the part!" shouted Heathman, and laughter drowned Mrs. Hacker's reply.
[Line 989] In good spirits the company broke up, and the young folk went away excited, the old people interested and amused.
[Line 990]  Merriment sounded on the grey July night; many women chattered about the play till long after their usual hour for sleep; and plenty of coarse jests as to the promised entertainment were uttered at the bar of 'The White Thorn' presently.
[Line 991]  As for the vicar and his sister, they felt that they had achieved a
[Line 992] triumph.  Two shadows alone darkened the outlook in Miss Masterman's
[Line 993] eyes.  She objected to the Nonconformist element as undesirable or
[Line 994] unnecessary; and she did not like the introduction of Queen Sabra.
[Line 995] "That showy girl is quite conceited enough already," she said.
[Line 996]  But her brother was young and warm-hearted.
[Line 997] "She's lovely, though," he said.  "By Jove! the play will be worth
[Line 998] doing, if only to see her got up like a princess!"
[Line 999]  "Don't be silly, Dennis," answered his sister.  "She's a rude wretch, and the Linterns are the most independent people in the parish." 
[Line 1000] CHAPTER IX
[Line 1001]  At high summer two men and two maids kept public holiday and wove romance under the great crown of Pen Beacon.  From this border height the South Hams spread in a mighty vision of rounded hills and plains; whole forests were reduced to squat, green cushions laid upon the broad earth's bosom; and amid them glimmered wedges and squares of ripening corn, shone root crops, smiled water meadows, and spread the emerald faces of shorn hayfields.
[Line 1002]  It was a day of lowering clouds and illumination breaking through them.
[Line 1003] Fans of light fell between the piled-up cumuli, and the earth was
[Line 1004] mottled with immense, alternate patches of shadow and sunshine.  Thick and visible strata of air hung heavy between earth and sky at this
[Line 1005] early hour.  They presaged doubt, and comprehended a condition that might presently diffuse and lift into unclouded glory of August light,
[Line 1006] or darken to thunderstorm.  Southerly the nakedness of Hanger Down and the crags of Eastern and Western Beacons towered; while to the east
[Line 1007] were Quickbeam Hill, Three Barrows, and the featureless expanses of Stall Moor.  Northerly towered Penshiel, and the waste spread beyond it
[Line 1008] in long leagues, whose planes were flattened out by distance and
[Line 1009] distinguished against each other by sleeping darkness and waking light. 
[Line 1010] A fuliginous heaviness, that stained air at earth's surface, persisted even on this lofty ground, and the highest passages of aerial radiance were not about the sun, but far beneath it upon the horizon.  Rupert Baskerville trudged doubtfully forward, sniffing the air and watching the sky, while beside him came Milly Luscombe; and a quarter
[Line 1011] of a mile behind them walked Mark and Cora Lintern.  The men had
[Line 1012] arranged to spend their holiday up aloft, and Milly was well pleased;
[Line 1013] but Cora held the expedition vain save for what it should accomplish. To dawdle in the Moor when she might have been at a holiday revel was not her idea of pleasure; but as soon as Mark issued his invitation she
[Line 1014] guessed that he did so with an object, and promised to join him.
[Line 1015]  As yet the definite word had not passed his lips, though it had hovered
[Line 1016] there; but to-day Miss Lintern was resolved to return from Pen Beacon betrothed.  As for Mark, his hope chimed with her intention.  Cora was
[Line 1017] always gracious and free of her time, while he played the devout lover
[Line 1018] and sincerely held her above him every way.  Only the week before
[Line 1019] Heathman, obviously inspired to do so, had asked him why he kept off, and declared that it would better become him to speak.  And now,
[Line 1020] feeling that the meal presently to be taken would be of a more joyous
[Line 1021] character after than before the deed, he stopped Cora while yet a mile
[Line 1022] remained to trudge before they should reach the top of the tor. 
[Line 1023] "Rest a bit," he said.  "Let Rupert and Milly go forward.  They don't want us, and we shall all meet in the old roundy-poundies up over,
[Line 1024] where we're going to eat our dinner."
[Line 1025]  "Looks as if 'twas offering for bad weather," she answered, lifting her
[Line 1026] eyes to the sky.  "I'm glad I didn't put on my new muslin."  She sat on a stone and felt that he was now going to ask her to marry
[Line 1027] him.  She was not enthusiastic about him at the bottom of her heart; but she knew that he would be rich and a good match for a girl in her position.  She was prone to exaggerate her beauty, and had hoped better
[Line 1028] things from it than Mark Baskerville; but certain minor romances with
[Line 1029] more important men had come to nothing.  She was practical and made herself see the bright side of the contract.  He was humble and she
[Line 1030] could influence him as she pleased.  He worshipped her and would doubtless continue to do so.
[Line 1031]  Once his wife she proposed to waken in him a better conceit of himself and, when his father died, she would be able to 'blossom out,' as she
[Line 1032] put it to her sister, and hold her head high in the land.  There were prospects.  Nathan Baskerville was rich also, and he was childless.  He liked Mark well, and on one occasion, when she came into the farm
[Line 1033] kitchen at Undershaugh suddenly, she overheard Nathan say to her
[Line 1034] mother, "No objection--none at all--a capital match for her." 
[Line 1035] Mark put down the basket that carried their meal and took a seat beside
[Line 1036] Cora.
[Line 1037] "'Tisn't going to rain," he said.  "I always know by my head if there's thunder in the elements.  It gets a sort of heavy, aching feeling. Look yonder, the clouds are levelling off above the Moor so true as if
[Line 1038] they'd been planed.  That's the wind's work.  Why, there's enough blue showing to make you a new dress a'ready, Cora."
[Line 1039]  "I'd love a dress of such blue as that.  Blue's my colour," she said.
[Line 1040] "Yes, it is--though you look lovely enough in any colour." 
[Line 1041] "I like to please you, Mark." 
[Line 1042] "Oh, Cora, and don't you please me?  Little you know--little you know.
[Line 1043] I've had it on my tongue a thousand times--yet it seems too bold--from
[Line 1044] such as me to you.  Why, there's none you mightn't look to; and if
[Line 1045] you'd come of a higher havage, you'd have been among the loveliest ladies in the land.  And so you are now, for that matter--only you're hid away in this savage old place--like a beautiful pearl under the wild sea."  This had long been Cora's own opinion.  She smiled and touched the hair on her hot forehead.
[Line 1046] "If there comes on a fog, I shall go out of curl in a minute," she
[Line 1047] said.  Then, seeing that this prophecy silenced him, she spoke again.
[Line 1048] "I love to hear you tell these kind things, Mark.  I'd sooner please you than any man living.  Perhaps 'tis over-bold in me to say so; but
[Line 1049] I'm telling nought but truth."  "Truth ban't often so beautiful as that," he said slowly.  "And 'tis like your brave heart to say it out; and here's truth for your truth,
[Line 1050] Cora.  If you care to hear me say I think well of you, then I care to hear you speak well of me; and more: nobody else's good word is better
[Line 1051] than wind in the trees against your slightest whisper.  So that I please you, I care nothing for all the world; and if you'll let me,
[Line 1052] I'll live for you and die for you.  For that matter I've lived for only you these many days, and if you'll marry me--there--'tis out.  I'm a vain chap even to dare to say it; but 'tis you have made me so--'tis your kind words and thoughts for me--little thoughts that peep out and
[Line 1053] dear little kind things done by you and forgotten by you; but never by me, Cora.  Can you do it?  Can you sink down to me, or is it too much
[Line 1054] of a drop?  Others have lowered themselves for love and never regretted
[Line 1055] it.  'Tis a fall for such a bright, lovely star as you; but my love's
[Line 1056] ready to catch you, so you shan't hurt yourself.  I--I----"  He broke off and she seemed really moved.  She put her hand on his two, which were knotted together; and then she looked love into his
[Line 1057] straining eyes and nodded.
[Line 1058]  His hands opened and seized hers and squeezed them till she drew in her breath.  Then he put his arms round her and kissed her.
[Line 1059] "Don't move, for God's sake!" he said.  "D'you know what you've done?"  "Given myself to a dear good chap," she answered.
[Line 1060] In her heart she was thanking heaven that she had not worn the new
[Line 1061] muslin dress.  "Weather or no weather, he'd have creased it and mangled it all over and ruined it for ever," she thought.
[Line 1062] They proceeded presently, but made no haste to overtake their
[Line 1063] companions.  Their talk was of the future and marriage.  He pressed for an early union; she was in no hurry.
[Line 1064] "You must learn a bit more about me first," she told him.  "Maybe I'm not half as nice as you think.  And there's your father.  I'm terrible frightened of him." 
[Line 1065] "You need not be, Cora.  He's not against early marriage.  You must come and see him pretty soon.  He'll be right glad for my sake, though he'll be sure to tell me I've had better luck than I deserve." 
[Line 1066] She considered awhile without speaking.
[Line 1067] "I'm afraid I shan't bring you much money," she said.
[Line 1068] "What's money?  That's the least thing.  I shall have plenty enough, no doubt."
[Line 1069] "What will your father do?  Then there's your uncle, Mr. Nathan.  He's terrible rich, by all accounts, and he thinks very well of you."  "I shall be all right.  But I'm a lazy man--too lazy.  I shall turn my
[Line 1070] hand to something steady when we're married."  "Such a dreamer you are.  Not but what, with all your great cleverness, you ban't worth all the young men put together for brains."
[Line 1071]  "I'm going to set to.  My father's often at me about wasting my life. But, though he'd scorn the word, he's a bit of a dreamer too--in his
[Line 1072] way.  You'd never guess it; but he spends many long hours all alone, brooding about things.  And he's a very sharp-eyed, clever man.  He
[Line 1073] marks the seasons by the things that happen out of doors.  He'll come
[Line 1074] down off our tor that cheerful sometimes, you wouldn't believe 'twas him.  'Curlew's back on the Moor,' he'll say one day; then another day, 'Oaks are budding'; then again, 'First frost to-night,' or 'Thunder's coming.'  His bark is worse than his bite, really."
[Line 1075]  "'Tis his terrible eyes I fear.  They look through you.  He makes me
[Line 1076] feel small, and I always hate anybody that does that."
[Line 1077] "You mustn't hate him.  Too many do already.  But 'twould be better to feel sorry for him.  He's often a very unhappy old man.  I feel it, but
[Line 1078] I can't see the reason, and he says nothing."
[Line 1079]  She pouted.  "I wish I hadn't got to see him.  Why, his own brother--your Uncle Nathan--even he can't hit it off with him.  And I'm sure there must be
[Line 1080] something wrong with a man that can't get on with Mr. Nathan. Everybody is fond of him; but I've often heard him say----"  "Leave it," interrupted Mark.  "I know all that, Cora.  'Tis just one of those puzzles that happen.  'Tis no good fretting about anybody
[Line 1081] else: what you've got to do is to make my father love you.  And you've only got to be yourself and he must love you."  "Of course I'll do my best."
[Line 1082] "Give me just one more lovely kiss, before we get over the hill-top and
[Line 1083] come in sight of them.  We're to meet at the 'old men's' camp." 
[Line 1084] She kissed him and then silence fell between them.  It lasted a long while until he broke it.
[Line 1085] "Don't fancy because I'm so still that I'm not bursting with joy," he
[Line 1086] said.  "But when I think of what's happened to me this minute, I feel
[Line 1087] 'tis too big for words.  The thoughts in me can't be spoken, Cora. They are too large to cram into little pitiful speeches."  "I'm getting hungry; and there's Milly waving," she answered.  "Milly's hungry too, belike." 
[Line 1088] Eastward, under Pen Beacon, lay an ancient lodge of the neolithic people.  The circles of scattered granite shone grey, set in foliage
[Line 1089] and fruit of the bilberry, with lichens on the stone and mosses woven
[Line 1090] into the grass about them.  A semicircle of hills extended beyond and
[Line 1091] formed a mighty theatre where dawn and storm played their parts, where falling night was pictured largely and moonshine slept upon lonely
[Line 1092] heights and valleys.  In the glen beneath spread Dendles Wood, with fringes of larch and pine hiding the River Yealm and spreading a
[Line 1093] verdant medley of deep summer green in the lap of the grey hills.  Gold autumn furzes flashed along the waste, and the pink ling broke into her first tremble of colourless light that precedes the blush of fulness.  The party of four sat in a hut circle and spoke little while they ate and drank.  Rupert, unknown to the rest, and much to his own
[Line 1094] inconvenience, had dragged up six stone bottles of ginger-beer hidden
[Line 1095] under his coat.  These he produced and was much applauded.  A spring broke at hand, and the bottles were sunk therein to cool them.
[Line 1096]  They talked together after a very practical and businesslike fashion. Milly and Rupert were definitely engaged in their own opinion, and now when Mark, who could not keep in the stupendous event of the moment,
[Line 1097] announced it, they congratulated the newly engaged couple with the
[Line 1098] wisdom and experience of those who had long entered that state. 
[Line 1099] "'Tis a devilish unrestful condition, I can promise you," said Rupert,
[Line 1100] "and the man always finds it so if the girl don't.  Hanging on is just hell--especially in my case, where I can't get father to see with my eyes.  But, thank God, Milly's jonic.  She won't change."
[Line 1101]  "No," said Milly, "I shan't change.  'Tis you have got to change.  I
[Line 1102] respect your father very much, like the rest of the world, but because he didn't marry till he was turned forty-five, that's no reason why you
[Line 1103] should wait twenty years for it.  Anyway, if you must, so will I--only I shall be a thought elderly for the business by that time.  However, it rests with you."  "I'm going--that's what she means," explained Rupert.  "Jack Head and me have had a talk, and he's thrown a lot of light on things in general.  I can't be bound hand and foot to my father like this; and if
[Line 1104] he won't meet me, I must take things into my own hands and leave home."
[Line 1105] Mark was staggered at the enormity of such a plan.
[Line 1106]  "Don't do anything in a hurry and without due thought."
[Line 1107] "Very well for you to talk," said Milly.  "You do nought but ring the bells on Sundays, and play at work the rest of the week.  Mr. Humphrey
[Line 1108] won't stand in your way.  I suppose you could be married afore Christmas, if you pleased."
[Line 1109] She sighed at the glorious possibility.
[Line 1110]  "I hope we shall be; but Cora's in no hurry, I'm afraid."
[Line 1111] "And when I've got work," continued Rupert, "then I shall just look round and take a house and marry; and why not?"  "Your father will never let you go.  It isn't to be thought upon,"
[Line 1112] declared Mark.  "Then he must be reasonable.  He appears to forget I'm nearly twenty-four," answered his cousin.
[Line 1113] Conversation ranged over their problems and their hopes.  Then Rupert touched another matrimonial disappointment.
[Line 1114]  "It looks as if we were not to be fortunate in love," he said.
[Line 1115] "There's Ned terrible down on his luck.  He's offered marriage
[Line 1116] again--to Farmer Chave's second daughter; and 'twas as good as done; but Mr. Chave wouldn't hear of it, and he's talked the girl round and Ned's got chucked."
[Line 1117]  "Serve him right," said Milly.  "He jilted two girls.  'Twill do him good to smart a bit himself."
[Line 1118] "The Chaves are a lot too high for us," asserted Mark.  "He's a very
[Line 1119] well-born and rich man, and his father was a Justice of the Peace, and
[Line 1120] known in London.  He only farms to amuse himself." 
[Line 1121] "'Twas Ned's face, I reckon," said Cora.  "They Chave women are both
[Line 1122] terrible stuck up.  Makes me sick to see 'em in church all in their
[Line 1123] town-made clothes.  But fine feathers won't make fine birds of them. They'm both flat as a plate, and a lot older than they pretend.  Ned is
[Line 1124] well out of it, I reckon." 
[Line 1125] "He don't think so, however," replied Rupert.  "I've never known him
[Line 1126] take any of his affairs to heart like this one.  Moped and gallied he is, and creeps about with a face as long as a fiddle; and off his food
[Line 1127] too." 
[Line 1128] "Poor chap," said Cora feelingly.
[Line 1129] "Even talks of ending it and making away with himself.  Terrible hard hit, I do believe."
[Line 1130]  "Your mother must be in a bad way about him," said Milly. 
[Line 1131] "She is.  Why, he took mother down to the river last Sunday and showed
[Line 1132] her a big hole there, where Plym comes over the rocks and the waters all a-boil and twelve feet deep.  'That's where you'll find me,
[Line 1133] mother,' he says.  And she, poor soul, was frightened out of her wits.
[Line 1134] And father's worried too, for Ned can't go wrong with him.  Ned may
[Line 1135] always do what he likes, though I may not."
[Line 1136] Cora declared her sympathy, but Mark did not take the incident as grave.
[Line 1137]  "You needn't fear," he assured Ned's brother.  "Men that talk openly of
[Line 1138] killing themselves, never do it.  Words are a safety-valve.  'Tis the
[Line 1139] sort that go silent and cheerful under a great blow that be nearest
[Line 1140] death." 
[Line 1141] Cora spoke of Ned's looks with admiration and feared that this great
[Line 1142] disappointment might spoil them; but Milly was not so sympathetic.  "If he stood to work and didn't think so much about the maidens, they might think a bit more about him," she said. 
[Line 1143] "He swears he won't play St. George now," added Rupert.  "He haven't got the heart to go play-acting no more."
[Line 1144]  "He'll find twenty girls to go philandering after afore winter," foretold Milly.  "And if Cora here was to ask him, he'd play St. George
[Line 1145] fast enough."
[Line 1146] "'Twill be a very poor compliment to me if he cries off now," declared
[Line 1147] Cora.  "For I'm to be the princess, and 'tis pretended in the play that
[Line 1148] he's my true lover."
[Line 1149]  "Mark will be jealous then.  'Tis a pity he don't play St. George," said Milly.  But Mark laughed.
[Line 1150]  "A pretty St. George me!" he answered.  "No, no; I'm not jealous of
[Line 1151] Ned.  Safety in numbers, they say.  Let him be St. George and welcome;
[Line 1152] and very noble he'll look--if ever he's got brains enough in his empty noddle to get the words and remember them." 
[Line 1153] Cora cast a swift side glance at her betrothed.  She did not speak, but the look was not all love.  Discontent haunted her for a little space.  The ginger-beer was drunk and the repast finished.  The men lighted
[Line 1154] their pipes; the girls talked together.
[Line 1155]  Milly congratulated Cora very heartily.
[Line 1156] "He's a fine, witty chap, as I've always said.  Different to most of us, along of being better eggicated.  But that modest and retiring, few
[Line 1157] people know what a clever man he is."
[Line 1158] These things pleased the other, and she was still more pleased when Milly discussed Mark's father. 
[Line 1159] "I often see him," she said--"oftener than you might think for.  He'll
[Line 1160] ride to Trowlesworthy twice and thrice a month sometimes.  Why for?  To
[Line 1161] see my uncle, you might fancy.  But that's not the reason.  To talk with Jack he comes.  Jack Head and me be the only people in these parts
[Line 1162] that ban't afraid of him.  And that's what he likes.  You be fearless
[Line 1163] of him, Cora, or he'll think nought of thee.  Fearless and attentive to what he says--that's the rule with him.  And pretend nothing, or he'll see through it and pull you to pieces.  Him and Jack Head says the most
[Line 1164] tremendous things about the world and its ways.  They take Uncle Saul's breath away sometimes, and mine too.  But don't let him frighten you--that's the fatal thing.  If a creature's feared of him, he
[Line 1165] despises it.  Never look surprised at his speeches."
[Line 1166]  Cora listened to this advice and thanked the other girl for it.  "Why should I care a button for the old man, anyway?" she asked.  "If
[Line 1167] it comes to that, I'm as good as him.  There's nought to fear really,
[Line 1168] when all's said.  And I won't fear." 
[Line 1169] The men strolled about the old village and gathered whortleberries;
[Line 1170] then Rupert judged that the storm that had skulked so long to the
[Line 1171] north, was coming at last.
[Line 1172]  "We'd best be getting down-along," he said.  "Let's go across to
[Line 1173] Trowlesworthy; then, if it breaks, we can slip into the warren house a bit till the worst be over.
[Line 1174] "You be all coming to drink tea there," said Milly.  "Uncle Saul and Jack Head are away, but aunt be home, and I made the cakes specially o'
[Line 1175] Saturday." 
[Line 1176] Drifting apart by a half a mile or so, the young couples left the
[Line 1177] Beacon, climbed Penshiel, and thence passed over the waste to where the
[Line 1178] red tor rose above Milly Luscombe's home.  A sort of twilight stole at four o'clock over the earth, and it seemed that night hastened up while yet the hidden sun was high.  The sinister sky darkened and frowned to bursting; yet no rain fell, and later it grew light again, as the sun, sinking beneath the ridges of the clouds, flooded the Moor with the greatest brightness that the day had known.
[Line 1179]  
[Line 1180]  CHAPTER X 
[Line 1181] Some few weeks after it was known that young Mark Baskerville would marry Cora Lintern, a small company drank beer at 'The White Thorn' and discussed local politics in general, and the engagement in particular.
[Line 1182] The time was three in the afternoon.
[Line 1183] "They'll look to you for a wedding present without a doubt," said Mr. Gollop to Nathan, who stood behind his bar.
[Line 1184] "And they'll be right," answered the innkeeper.  "I'm very fond of 'em
[Line 1185] both."  "You'll be put to it to find rich gifts for all your young people, however."  "That's as may be.  If the Lord don't send you sons, the Devil will
[Line 1186] send you nephews--you know the old saying.  Not but what Vivian's boys
[Line 1187] and girls are a very nice lot--I like 'em all very well indeed.  Mark's different--clever enough, but made of another clay.  His mother was a
[Line 1188] retiring, humble woman--frightened of her own shadow, you might say.
[Line 1189] However, Cora will wake him into a cheerfuller conceit of himself." 
[Line 1190] There was an interruption, for Dennis Masterman suddenly filled the doorway.
[Line 1191] "The very men I want," he said; then he entered.
[Line 1192] "Fine sweltering weather for the harvest, your honour," piped an old
[Line 1193] fellow who sat on a settle by the window with a mug of beer beside him.
[Line 1194]  "So it is, Abel, and I hope there's another month of it to come.  Give me half a pint of the mild, will you, Baskerville?  'Tis about the rehearsal I've looked in.  Thursday week is the day--at seven o'clock
[Line 1195] sharp, remember.  And I'm very anxious that everybody shall know their
[Line 1196] words.  It will save a lot of trouble and help us on."  "I've got mine very near," said Nathan. 
[Line 1197] "So have I," declared Mr. Gollop.  "Here I, the King of Egypt, boldly do appear; St. Garge, St. Garge, walk in, my only son and heir!"
[Line 1198] "Yes, but you mustn't say '_h_eir'; the h isn't sounded, you know.  Has
[Line 1199] anybody seen Ned Baskerville?  I heard that he was in trouble."
[Line 1200]  "Not at all," said Nathan.  "He's all right--a lazy rascal.  'Twas only another of his silly bits of work with the girls.  Running after Mr. Chave's daughter.  Like his cheek!"
[Line 1201]  Mr. Masterman looked astonished.  "I thought Mr. Chave----" he said.  "Exactly, vicar; you thought right.  'Tis just his handsome face makes my nephew so pushing.  We be a yeoman race, we Baskervilles, though said to be higher once; but of course, as things are, Ned looking there
[Line 1202] was just infernal impudence, though his good old pig-headed father, my
[Line 1203] brother, couldn't see it.  He's only blind when Ned's the matter."
[Line 1204] "'Twas said he was going to jump in the river," declared the ancient Abel.
[Line 1205] "Nonsense and rubbish!" declared Nathan.  "Ned's not that sort.  Wait
[Line 1206] till he sees himself in the glittering armour of St. George, and he'll
[Line 1207] soon forget his troubles."  "We must talk about the dresses after rehearsal.  A good many can be
[Line 1208] made at home."
[Line 1209] "Be you going to charge at the doors?" asked Mr. Gollop.  "I don't see
[Line 1210] why for we shouldn't." 
[Line 1211] "Yes, certainly I am," answered Dennis.  "The money will go to rehanging the bells.  That's settled.  Well, remember.  And stir up Joe
[Line 1212] Voysey, Thomas.  You can do anything with him, but I can't.  Remind him
[Line 1213] about the French Eagle.  He's only got to learn six lines, but he says it makes his head ache so badly that he's sure he'll never do it."
[Line 1214] "I'll try and fire the man's pride," declared Mr. Gollop.  "Joe's not a day over sixty-eight, and he's got a very fair share of intellect.  He shall learn it, if I've got to teach him."
[Line 1215] "That's right.  Now I must be off."
[Line 1216] When the vicar was gone Gollop reviewed the situation created by young
[Line 1217] Masterman's energy and tact.
[Line 1218]  "I never could have foreseen it, yet the people somehow make shift to
[Line 1219] do with him.  It don't say much for him, but it says a lot for us--for our sense and patience.  We'm always ready to lend the man a hand in
[Line 1220] reason, and I wish he was more grateful; but I shouldn't call him a
[Line 1221] grateful man.  Of course, this here play-acting will draw the eyes of
[Line 1222] the country on us, and he'll get the credit, no doubt; yet 'twill be us
[Line 1223] two men here in this bar--me and you, Nathan--as will make or mar all." 
[Line 1224] "I'm very glad to help him.  He's a good chap, and my sort.  Lots of fun in the man when you know him."
[Line 1225] "Can't say I look at him like that.  He's not enough beholden to the
[Line 1226] past, in my opinion.  However, I believe he's woke up a bit to who I am
[Line 1227] and what my sister is," answered Gollop.
[Line 1228]  "Not your fault if he hasn't." 
[Line 1229] "And another thing--he don't take himself seriously enough," continued the parish clerk.  "As a man I grant you he has got nought to take
[Line 1230] seriously.  He's young, and he's riddled with evil, modern ideas that would land the country in ruin if followed.  But, apart from that, as a minister he ought to be different.  I hate to see him running after the
[Line 1231] ball at cricket, like a school-child.  'Tisn't decent, and it lessens the force of the man in the pulpit come Sunday, just as it lessened the force of physician Dawe to Tavistock when he took to singing comic songs at the penny readings.  Why, 'twas money out of the doctor's
[Line 1232] pocket, as he lived to find out, too late.  When Old Master Trelawny lay dying, and they axed un to let Dawe have a slap at un, he wouldn't do it.  'Be that the man that sang the song about locking his mother-in-law into the coal-cellar?' he axed.  'The same,' said they; 'but he's a terrible clever chap at the stomach, and may save you yet if there be enough of your organs left for him to work upon.'  'No,
[Line 1233] no,' says old Trelawny.  'Such a light-minded feller as that couldn't
[Line 1234] be trusted with a dying man's belly.'  I don't say 'twas altogether reasonable, because the wisest must unbend the bow now and again; but I will maintain that that minister of the Lord didn't ought to take off
[Line 1235] his coat and get in a common sweat afore the people assembled at a cricket match.  'Tis worse than David making a circus of himself afore the holy ark; and if he does so, he must take the consequences." 
[Line 1236] "The consequences be that everybody will think a lot better of him, as
[Line 1237] a manly and sensible chap, wishful to help the young men," declared Mr. Baskerville.  "One thing I can bear witness to: I don't get the
[Line 1238] Saturday custom I used to get, and that's to the good, anyway."  Then
[Line 1239] he looked at his watch and changed the subject.
[Line 1240]  "Mrs. Lintern's daughter is paying a sort of solemn visit to my brother
[Line 1241] to-day, and they are all a little nervous about it."  "He'll terrify her out of her wits," said Mr. Gollop.  "He takes a dark
[Line 1242] delight in scaring the young people." 
[Line 1243] "'Tisn't that, 'tis his manner.  He don't mean to hurt 'em.  A difficult man, however, as I know only too well."
[Line 1244] "If he can't get on with you, there's a screw loose in him," remarked the old man, sitting on the settle.
[Line 1245]  "I won't say that, Abel; but I don't know why 'tis that he's got no use for me."
[Line 1246]  "No loss, however," asserted Thomas.  "A cranky and heartless creature.
[Line 1247] The likes of him couldn't neighbour with the likes of us--not enough
[Line 1248] human kindness in him."
[Line 1249]  "Like our father afore him, and yet harder," explained the publican. "I can see my parent now--dark and grim, and awful old to my young eyes.  Well I remember the first time I felt the sting of him.  A terrible small boy I was--hadn't cast my short frocks, I believe--but I'd sinned in some little matter, and he give me my first flogging. And the picture I've got of father be a man with a hard, set face, with
[Line 1250] a bit of a grim smile on it, and his right hand hidden behind him.  But
[Line 1251] I knowed what was in it!  A great believer in the rod.  He beat us
[Line 1252] often--all three of us--till we'd wriggle and twine like a worm on a hook; but our uncle, the musicker, he was as different as you
[Line 1253] please--soft and gentle, like my nephew Mark, and all for spoiling
[Line 1254] childer with sweeties and toys."
[Line 1255] Mr. Gollop rose to depart, and others entered.  Then Nathan called a
[Line 1256] pot-man and left the bar. 
[Line 1257] "I promised Mrs. Lintern as I'd go down to hear what Cora had to say," he explained.  "I'm very hopeful that she's had the art to win Humphrey, for 'twill smooth the future a good bit for the people at
[Line 1258] Undershaugh if my brother takes to the wench.  You'd think nobody could
[Line 1259] help it--such a lovely face as she has.  However, we shall know how it fell out inside an hour or so."
[Line 1260] Meanwhile Cora, clad in her new muslin, had faced Humphrey Baskerville, and faced him alone.  For her future father-in-law expressly wished
[Line 1261] this, and Mark was from home on the occasion of his sweetheart's visit. Cora arrived twenty minutes before dinner, and watched Susan Hacker dish it up.  She had even offered to assist, but Susan would not permit it.
[Line 1262]  "Better you go into the parlour and keep cool, my dear," she said.
[Line 1263] "You'll need to be.  Master's not in the best of tempers to-day.  And
[Line 1264] your young man left a message.  He be gone to Plympton, and will be back by four o'clock; so, when you take your leave, you are to go down the Rut and meet him at Torry Brook stepping-stones, if you please."
[Line 1265] "Where's Mr. Baskerville?"
[Line 1266]  "Taking the air up 'pon top the tor.  He bides there most mornings till
[Line 1267] the dinner hour, and he'd forget his meal altogether so often as not,
[Line 1268] but I go to the hedge and ring the dinner bell.  Then he comes down."
[Line 1269]  "How can I best please him, Susan?" 
[Line 1270] "By listening first, and by talking afterwards.  He don't like a
[Line 1271] chatterbox, but he don't like young folk to be too silent neither.
[Line 1272] 'Twill be a hugeous heave-up of luck if you can get on his blind side.
[Line 1273] Few can--I warn you of that.  He's very fond of natural, wild things. If you was to talk about the flowers and show him you be fond of
[Line 1274] nature, it might be well.  However, do as you will, he'll find out the truth of 'e." 
[Line 1275] "I'm all of a tremor.  I wish you hadn't told me that."  "Mark might have told you.  Still, for your comfort it may be said you're built the right way.  You'll be near so full-blown as I be, come you pass fifty.  He hates the pinikin,[1] pin-tailed sort.  Be cheerful,
[Line 1276]  [1] _Pinikin_--delicate.
[Line 1277]  eat hearty, don't leave nothing on your plate, and wait for him to say grace afore and after meat.  The rest must fall out according to your
[Line 1278] own sense and wit.  Now I be going to ring the bell."
[Line 1279]  "I half thought that he might come part of the way to meet me."
[Line 1280] "You thought wrong, then.  He don't do that sort of thing." 
[Line 1281] "I wish Mark was here, Susan." 
[Line 1282] "So does Mark.  But master has his own way of doing things, and 'tis generally the last way that other people would use."  Mrs. Hacker rang the bell, and the thin, black figure of Humphrey Baskerville appeared and began to creep down the side of the hill.  He
[Line 1283] had, of course, met Cora on previous occasions, but this was the first
[Line 1284] time that he had spoken with the girl since her betrothal.  He shook hands and hoped that her mother was well. 
[Line 1285] "A harvest to make up for last year," he said.  "You ought to be
[Line 1286] lending a hand by rights."  "I don't think Mr. Baskerville would like for Polly and me to do that. 'Tis too hot," she said.
[Line 1287] "Nathan wouldn't?  Surely he would.  Many hands make light work and
[Line 1288] save the time.  You're a strong girl, aren't you?"
[Line 1289]  "Strong as a pony, sir."  "Don't call me 'sir.'  And you're fond of wild nature and the
[Line 1290] country--so Mark tells me."
[Line 1291]  "That I am, and the wild flowers." 
[Line 1292] "Why didn't you wear a bunch of 'em then?  Better them than that
[Line 1293] davered[2] rose stuck in your belt.  Gold by the look of it--the belt I
[Line 1294] mean."
[Line 1295]   [2] _Davered_--withered.
[Line 1296]  
[Line 1297] She laughed.  "I'll let you into the secret," she said.  "I wanted to be smart to-day, and so I took one of my treasures.  You'll never guess where
[Line 1298] this gold belt came from, Mr. Baskerville?"  "Don't like it, anyway," he answered.
[Line 1299]  "Why, 'twas the hat-band round my grandfather's hat!  He was a beadle
[Line 1300] up to some place nigh London; and 'twas an heirloom when he died; and mother gived it to me, and here it is."  He regarded the relic curiously.  "A funny world, to be sure," he said.  "Little did that bygone man think of such a thing when he put his braided hat on his head, I'll warrant." 
[Line 1301] He relapsed into a long silence, and Cora's remarks were rewarded with
[Line 1302] no more than nods of affirmation or negation.  Then, suddenly, he broke out on the subject of apparel long after she thought that he had
[Line 1303] forgotten it.
[Line 1304] "Terrible tearing fine I suppose you think your clothes are, young
[Line 1305] woman--terrible tearing fine; but I hate 'em, and they ill become a poor man's wife and a poor man's daughter.  My mother wore her hair frapped back light and plain, with a forehead cloth, and a little blue
[Line 1306] baize rochet over her breast, and a blue apron and short gown and hob-nailed shoon; and she looked ten thousand times finer than ever you
[Line 1307] looked in your life--or ever can in that piebald flimsy, with those Godless smashed birds on your head.  What care you for nature to put a
[Line 1308] bit of a dead creature 'pon top of your hair?  A nasty fashion, and I'm sorry you follow it." 
[Line 1309] She kept her temper well under this terrific onslaught.  "We must follow the fashion, Mr. Baskerville.  But I'll not wear this hat again afore you, since you don't like it."  "Going to be married and live up to your knees in clover, eh?  So you both think.  Now tell me what you feel like to my son, please."
[Line 1310] "I love him dearly, I'm sure, and I think he's a very clever chap, and
[Line 1311] quite the gentleman in all his ways.  Though he might dress a bit
[Line 1312] smarter, and not be so friendly with the other bellringers.  Because they are commoner men than him, of course."
[Line 1313]  "'Quite the gentleman'--eh?  What's a gentleman?"  "Oh, dear, Mr. Baskerville, you'll spoil my dinner with such a lot of
[Line 1314] questions.  To be a gentleman is to be like Mark, I suppose--kind and
[Line 1315] quick to see what a girl wants; and to be handsome and be well thought
[Line 1316] of by everybody, and all the rest of it."  "You go a bit too high at instep," he said.  "You're too vain of your pretty face, and you answer rather pertly.  You don't know what a
[Line 1317] gentleman is, for all you think yourself a fine lady.  And I'll tell you this: very few people do know what a gentleman is.  You can tell a lot about people by hearing them answer when you ask them what a gentleman is.  Where would you like to live?"
[Line 1318]  "Where 'twould please Mark best.  And if the things I say offend you,
[Line 1319] I'm sorry for it.  You must make allowances, Mr. Baskerville.  I'm
[Line 1320] young, and I've not got much sense yet; but I want to please you--I
[Line 1321] want to please everybody, for that matter."  This last remark much interested her listener.  He started and looked at the girl fixedly.  Then his expression changed, and he appeared to
[Line 1322] stare through her at somebody or something beyond.  Behind Cora the old man did, indeed, see another very clearly in his mind's eye.  After a painful silence she spoke again, and her tone was troubled.
[Line 1323]  "I want to say the thing that will please you, if I can.  But I must be
[Line 1324] myself.  I'm sorry if you don't like me."  "You must be yourself, and so must I," he answered; "and if I'm not
[Line 1325] liking you, you're loathing me.  But we're getting through our dinner very nicely.  Will you have any more of this cherry tart?"  "No, I've done well."
[Line 1326]  "You've eaten nought to name.  I've spoiled your appetite, and
[Line 1327] you--well, you've done more than you think, and taught me more than you
[Line 1328] know yourself." 
[Line 1329] She shrugged her shoulders. 
[Line 1330] "Mark says puzzling things like that sometimes."
[Line 1331] There was another silence.
[Line 1332]  "You ride a pony, don't you?" he asked presently; and the girl brightened up.  Mr. Baskerville possessed some of the best ponies on
[Line 1333] Dartmoor, and sold a noted strain of his own raising.
