[Line 0] tales.  They looked on them as fellow-humans.  And the feeling was reciprocated.  Look, for instance, at how they kept the same servants all their service.  Nowadays there is a general howl of the badness of
[Line 1] Indian servants and their untrustworthiness.  It was not so then.  One of the most pleasing features of that old life was the affection often shown between masters and servants.  Dickens has noted it.  How much of
[Line 2] that do you find now?  Not much.  A little still there is--who should
[Line 3] know better than I?  And if now it is so rare, where is the fault?
[Line 4] Good masters make good servants.  And it requires so little goodness in the master--only a little consideration, a friendly word sometimes.
[Line 5] They give back far more than they receive.  If there are many bad
[Line 6] servants, who makes them bad?  Their masters; those with whom they began their service, who did not know how to treat them, how to help
[Line 7] them, how to keep them.  At Arcot the Sepoys gave the rice to their officers and took the conjee themselves; how many regiments would do
[Line 8] that now?
[Line 9]  I do not say that there was ever close personal intercourse between
[Line 10] English and Indian; there was not, and in the nature of things there could not be.  But there were mutual consideration and mutual respect. "We have different ways and different customs; we have different skins. But underneath it all we are both men."  So they thought in the old days.
[Line 11]  Thus in the old days the embryo official came out young, free from
[Line 12] prejudices, full of enthusiasms, ready to learn, to read, to mark,
[Line 13] learn, and inwardly digest all phases of Oriental life about him.  Even
[Line 14] thirty years ago when I first went to India there were many of this
[Line 15] type still left.  They thought it their duty, as it was their pleasure,
[Line 16] to study the people in order to understand what lay beneath their customs.  It must be thirty years ago that an old civilian turned on me
[Line 17] sharply when I made some ignorant remark about some Malabar custom and said: "The custom has arisen out of the circumstances of life and no peculiarity of nature in the people.  All peoples are much alike in fundamentals, and great apparent differences are but superficial, and arise from environment." 
[Line 18] The absurd doctrine of the "Oriental mind" had not then arisen to be an
[Line 19] excuse for ignorance and want of understanding.  Nowadays it is supposed to be the mark of culture to talk of it; to the old officials
[Line 20] it would have been the mark of a fool; they thought it their duty to study the people.
[Line 21]  But it is not so now.  Young civilians come out with their minds
[Line 22] already closed, and, as a rule, closed they remain.  The harm is done in England before they start.  Let me give instances.
[Line 23]  It is a custom when a young civilian joins to send him to a district head-quarters for six months first, to learn his way about before
[Line 24] posting him to any specified work.  One such was sent to me ten years ago, and if I give an account of him it will do for all.  For nowadays they are all turned out of the same mill, have all the same habits of mind and thought, and their personalities are submerged.  If anything,
[Line 25] he of whom I speak was above the average in all ways.
[Line 26] He was a very nice young fellow, with charming manners, and I greatly liked him.
[Line 27] He became an officer of great promise, and would have risen high, but he is dead now, and therefore what I say now cannot offend anyone. Besides, I have nothing to say that would offend.  He was, I think, twenty-three years of age, of good people, educated at a public school
[Line 28] and Oxford, and was as nice a boy as could be found.  He had passed
[Line 29] high in the examinations.  He was said to be clever, and as regards
[Line 30] assimilating paper knowledge, he was able, but his mind was an old
[Line 31] curiosity shop.  He had fixed ideas in nearly everything.  He was full of prejudices he called principles, of "facts" that were not true.  He
[Line 32] had learnt a great deal, he knew nothing; and worse--he did not know how to obtain knowledge.  He wanted his opinions ready-made and absolute first, and only sought for such facts as would support those principles.  He had no notion how to make knowledge by himself.  He
[Line 33] wanted authority before he would think.  Give him "authority," and he would disregard or deny fact in order to cling to it.  I will take a concrete instance.
[Line 34]  There is amongst Englishmen in Burma a superstition that the Burmese do
[Line 35] not and cannot work.  They are "lazy."  The men never work if they can help it, and all the work that is done is done by women.  How this idea arose is an interesting study in the psychology of ignorance, but I
[Line 36] need not enter into that now.  The idea obtains universally, and is an acknowledged shibboleth.  My young assistant was not with me many days
[Line 37] before he brought it up.
[Line 38]  "Oh," he said, "the Burman is so lazy."
[Line 39] "You are sure of that?" I asked.
[Line 40]  He stared at me.  "Why, everyone says so."  "Everyone said four hundred years ago that the sun went round the earth," I answered; "were they right?"  "You don't mean to tell me," he said, "that the Burmese can work."
[Line 41] "I don't mean to tell you anything," I answered.  "Here are a quarter of a million Burmese in this district.  Find out the facts for
[Line 42] yourself."  The necessity of having to support his theories with facts seemed to
[Line 43] him unreasonable.  "But," he objected, "I can see they are lazy."  The Burman is lazy.  That is enough said.  What have facts to do with it?
[Line 44] He did not say this, but undoubtedly he was thinking it.  However, at last he did find what he considered a fact.
[Line 45] "You remember, when we rode into that village the other day about noon,
[Line 46] the number of men we saw sleeping in the veranda?"  "True," I said.
[Line 47]  "Does not that show it?"
[Line 48]  "Suppose," I said, "you had got up at four o'clock in the morning and
[Line 49] worked till ten, in the fields, would you not require a rest before going out at three o'clock again?"
[Line 50]  "Do they do that?" he asked.
[Line 51]  "You can find out for yourself if they do or not," I answered.  He looked at me doubtfully. 
[Line 52] "But," he objected, "it is notorious."
[Line 53]  "So is the fact that the standard of living in Burma is very high.  How do you reconcile the two?  Laziness and comfort.  The comfort is evident and real, perhaps the laziness is only apparent."  "A rich country," he said.  "Is it?" I asked.  "Look at the dry, bare land, of which nearly all this district and most of Upper Burma are composed.  Is it rich?  You have eyes to see.  You know it is not rich; why do you say it is?" 
[Line 54] He shook his head almost as if I had hurt him and searched about for a defence.  "But Lower Burma is rich."  "Certainly; and if you look at the export returns you will see the enormous amount of rice it grows and exports.  Is that rice the product
[Line 55] of laziness?"
[Line 56] "But," he said at last in despair, "if this laziness of the Burman is untrue, how did the idea become general?"  "Ah," I answered, "that is another matter.  Let us stick to one thing at a time.  We are concerned now with whether it is true or not.
[Line 57] Decide that first.  See for yourself.  Find out an ordinary man's work and I think you will find it is sufficient.  You have the opportunity
[Line 58] of judging, and unless you use that opportunity you have no right to an opinion at all." 
[Line 59] He said no more at the time, but a few days later he returned to the
[Line 60] subject.  A High Official had been opening a public work in Mandalay and had made a speech.  Much of the labour for the work had been
[Line 61] Burmese, where usually such labour is imported Indian, and he referred with satisfaction to the fact.  "I am glad to see," said the High Official, "that the Burmese are taking to hard work."  My assistant
[Line 62] brought this up.  "Here is authority," he said.
[Line 63] "Certainly," I said; "there is authority on one side; now let us look
[Line 64] at fact on the other; whether is it better to be a peasant-proprietor on your own land or a day-labourer?"
[Line 65]  "The proprietor, of course," he said. 
[Line 66] "This has been a bad year in some districts.  Crops have failed.  You
[Line 67] can read that from the weekly reports in my office.  Many cultivators have had to abandon their holdings and turn to day labour.  Is that good?  Are they to be congratulated on it?"
[Line 68]  The boy looked downcast.
[Line 69] "No," he admitted.  "Well, then," I asked, "what will they think of a Government who says
[Line 70] such things?"
[Line 71] He reflected for some time.  "But," he said at length, "when one
[Line 72] authority (the High Official) says one thing and another authority (you) says the reverse, what am I to believe?"
[Line 73]  Then came my opportunity.  "You are to believe nothing," I said.  "You
[Line 74] have eyes, you have ears, you have common sense.  They are given you to
[Line 75] use and see facts for yourself.  The facts are all round you.  You will never do any good work if you refuse to face facts and understand them.
[Line 76] If you are to be worth your salt as an official you will have to work
[Line 77] by sight, not by faith." 
[Line 78] He laughed.  At first he seemed puzzled; then he was pleased.  He had been educated to accept what he was told and never to question.  His
[Line 79] mind had been stunted and the idea of exercising it again delighted him.  To judge by himself was a new idea to him entirely and he
[Line 80] welcomed it.  He began to do so.  For the first time since childhood he was encouraged to use that which is the only thing worth cultivating--his common sense.  But even yet he could not emancipate
[Line 81] himself.  Some time later a new subject came up.  This time it was the
[Line 82] disappearance of the Burman.  He is supposed to be dying out.  The
[Line 83] Indian is "ousting" him.  Before long there will be none left.  My assistant had read it in the paper and heard it almost universally,
[Line 84] therefore it must be true.  I said nothing at the time, but that day when I went to office I sent him the volumes of the last two Census
[Line 85] tables with a short note.  "Will you kindly," I wrote, "make out for me:
[Line 86]   the Burmese population in 1891
[Line 87]   the same in 1901
[Line 88] district by district, and let me know where there have been decreases, also increases, and the percentage of increase."  The next day he came to me with an amused expression on his face and a
[Line 89] paper of figures in his hand. 
[Line 90] "I have made them all out," he said, "as you wished.  Here they are." 
[Line 91] "Then," I said, "let us take the districts with the decreases first. Please show me them."  "There are none," he answered.  "They all show increases."
[Line 92]  "Large?" I asked.
[Line 93] "Yes, large," he said; "from a population of about nine million to ten million in ten years is a good increase.  The Burmese are prolific."  "But," I remarked also, "I thought the Burman was disappearing?  You said so on authority.  How is that?" 
[Line 94] He laughed; he had taken his lesson.
[Line 95]  And again, another point.  I had received an order from Government
[Line 96] which I thought was mistaken, and I said so.  He was a Government
[Line 97] official too, and I could say to him what I could not say to others.
[Line 98]  "Then you won't carry it out?"  he asked, surprised.
[Line 99]  "I am here to carry out orders," I answered, "and of course I shall
[Line 100] carry it out."  "But why then do you criticise it, if it must be carried out?"
[Line 101] "Look here," I said, "before very long you will be sent to a
[Line 102] subdivision of my district to govern it.  I shall send you many orders,
[Line 103] and shall expect you to carry them out." 
[Line 104] "Right or wrong?"  "Right or--as you may think--wrong.  You must do as I say.  Without this, government is impossible.  But I do not want you to think as I
[Line 105] do.  I want you to think for yourself.  If an order appears to you
[Line 106] issued from a misconception on my part, you must not refuse to obey;
[Line 107] but I should expect you to tell me any facts that would lead me to better knowledge.  Your business is not merely to carry out orders, but
[Line 108] to furnish me with correct information how to better those orders.  You
[Line 109] are not merely to be part of the district hand, but of its brain too. I should want you to criticise every order in your mind, try to
[Line 110] understand it, and if you disagree with it to examine your reasons for disagreement and see if they are good."  "And let you know?" 
[Line 111] "Whenever you are certain that I am wrong, and the matter is important."  "But would not criticism be cheek?"
[Line 112]  "Not if it is true and valuable.  You would be doing me a valuable service.  It is what I want.  How do you suppose we are ever to get on if opinions are to be stereotyped?  Thought must be free.  But don't give me opinions or 'authority.'  I don't care for either.  Give me facts, and be sure of your facts." 
[Line 113] "I see," he said.  "You can be quite kind about it, you know," I suggested.  "Is that what you are to Government," he asked, "when you disagree with them?"  "I try to be," I said.  "I put myself as far as I can in their position, and give them what I would like to receive myself."
[Line 114]  Again it was quite a new idea to him that anyone should want criticism.
[Line 115] He had been educated to believe that any doubt of what authority said was a sin, perhaps inevitable sometimes, but anyhow always to be concealed; and he had been told that everyone, from the Creator down, resented criticisms and would annihilate the critic.  That anyone should prefer knowing the truth even if it prove him wrong seemed to him impossible.  He did not like ever to admit he had been wrong.  He thought truth was absolute and fixed, whereas it is relative and always growing.  He had, unconsciously, the mind of the Pharisee in the Temple.  Now these three instances will point out what seems to me to be wrong
[Line 116] in the previous training of young men sent to India, and in fact in all
[Line 117] training.  Their minds instead of being cultivated are stifled.  They are taught to disregard fact and to accept authority in place of it. They are not only to do what they are told, which is right; but to
[Line 118] think what they are told, which is wrong.  And they do.  They are taught to repeat in parrot manner stock phrases and imagine they are
[Line 119] thinking.  And this habit once acquired is difficult to get rid of.
[Line 120] With most it never is got rid of.  You will, for instance, find these
[Line 121] shibboleths of the "disappearing Burman" and his "laziness" repeated by the highest officials who have been longest in the country, all of whom
[Line 122] have facts in their office disproving them.  And these are not the only prejudices nor even the principal.  They are innumerable and serious. You will in consequence find that administration and even legislation
[Line 123] are affected by them.  The whole attitude of Government to the people it governs is vitiated in this way.  There is a want of knowledge and
[Line 124] understanding.  In place of it are fixed opinions based usually on
[Line 125] prejudice or on faulty observation, or on circumstances which have changed, and they are never corrected.  Young secretaries read up back circulars, and repeat their errors indefinitely.  That is "following precedent."  They will quote you complacently: 
[Line 126]   "Freedom broadening slowly down   From precedent to precedent"  and never see the absurdity of the lines.  Freedom is the disregard of precedent where the precedent is wrong or out of date.  There is throughout nearly all English officials (and non-officials) in
[Line 127] India not only a disregard of facts about them, but a want of any real sympathy with the people among whom they live, which is astonishing. They often like the "natives," they often are kind to them, wish them well, and do their best for them, but that is not sympathy.  Sympathy
[Line 128] is understanding.  It is being able to put yourself in another's place.  I could tell many stories illustrating this want of understanding.  One will suffice.  An official I knew well, an excellent fellow,
[Line 129] kind-hearted, humorous, and able, holding a good position then and a high one now, with a charming wife, living amongst the Burmese and ruling them, with Burmese servants, clerks, and peons, and continual
[Line 130] Burmese visitors of all classes, called his dog "Alaung."  Now "Alaung"
[Line 131] means something very similar to "Messiah," and is a sacred word.  A
[Line 132] parallel would be if, say, a Parsee in England called his dog "Christ."
[Line 133] I have seen this official's servants wince when he called out to his
[Line 134] dog.  Yet I am sure it never struck him that there was anything out of
[Line 135] the way in this nomenclature.  I am sure he never dreamed he would hurt
[Line 136] anyone's feelings by it, or he would not have done it.  He certainly intended no jeer at the religion of his subordinates.  It was simply
[Line 137] that he wanted understanding.
[Line 138] Now sympathy is inherent in all children, and is the means whereby they
[Line 139] acquire all the real knowledge they have.  A girl being a mother to her
[Line 140] doll, a boy being a soldier or hunter, is exercising and training the
[Line 141] most valuable of all gifts--imaginative sympathy.  It is the only emotion which brings real knowledge of the world about you.  Without it
[Line 142] you never understand anything. 
[Line 143] It should be incessantly cultivated and fed with real facts to enable it to grow, and to turn what your sympathy leads you to suspect into
[Line 144] what knowledge confirms.  In all young men nowadays it is destroyed by their education.  Their minds are fitted up with obsolete and mistaken prejudices, which are called principles, and then the door is locked. They all talk the same, act the same, have the same ideas in their
[Line 145] heads.  None of them ever think over what is all about them.  They do
[Line 146] their work by paper knowledge and paper principles; the great book of humanity has been sealed for them.  When they try to think they cannot do so.  They have lost the power their childhood had.  They argue in the most extraordinary way.  They will make a statement, and if it is
[Line 147] disproved say, "Well, if it is not true it ought to be," and go on as
[Line 148] if that made it true.  They will resort to prophecy, and say, "If not true to-day it will be to-morrow," and so settle it.
[Line 149]  Now if brighter days are to be in store for India official or
[Line 150] non-official, English or native, all this must be altered.  The whole principles of education must be revised or abandoned.  The less
[Line 151] educated a man is now the more real understanding he is likely to have.
[Line 152] The educated man is a mental automaton.  He has sold his soul and got in its place some maxims, with the aid of which he seeks to govern the
[Line 153] world.  He thinks knowledge is got from books.  It is not.  Books are
[Line 154] most valuable helps, showing you new views of life, giving you new
[Line 155] facts, showing you how to think; but they never give you knowledge of
[Line 156] life.  Only experience can do that.  But the young man now does not
[Line 157] want to know what is, but what other people say.  He is afraid of
[Line 158] himself and yearns for authority. 
[Line 159] This has been evident to all who have looked into the matter.  Here is what a modern writer says:  "No English schoolboy is ever taught to speak the truth for the very simple reason that he is never taught to desire the truth.  From the very first he is taught to be totally careless as to whether a fact is
[Line 160] a fact; he is taught to care only whether the 'fact' can be used on his side when he is engaged in 'playing the game.'"  Nothing could be more true than this.  He is provided with fixed ideas, and he will welcome any fact that supports them, while deliberately
[Line 161] refusing all facts which are opposed to his ideas.  He thinks and
[Line 162] argues to prove his preconceived point, never to elicit truth
[Line 163] regardless of whether that truth agrees with his preconceptions or not.
[Line 164] In fact, he is taught not to think.  The Inward Light which is in all children has been put out.  He has become a spiritual coward; he dare
[Line 165] not look the whole truth in the face.  He thinks that patriotism
[Line 166] consists in supporting his country or his class through thick and thin.
[Line 167] It does not occur to him that the higher patriotism is to try to help his country or his class not to go wrong, or if wrong to get right.  He would rather bolster up a mistake, shut his eyes to the fact that it is
[Line 168] a mistake, and go on doing it, than admit his wrong.  It is better in his eyes to be consistently wrong than by admitting mistakes and correcting them to be inconsistent.  He cannot learn.
[Line 169]  CHAPTER IV  HIS SUBSEQUENT TRAINING  Therefore there is a wide difference between the men as they came out
[Line 170] in the old days and as they come out now.  Then they were young, not very well instructed but capable of seeing, understanding, and
[Line 171] learning; nowadays they are so drilled and instructed that they can deal only with books, papers, and records; life has been closed to them; they can enforce laws, but not temper them.
[Line 172]  After they come out the difference of life and work is still greater.
[Line 173] In the old days, for instance, they picked up the language quickly and well.  The time to learn a language is when you are young--the younger the better.  We learn our own language as children.  The older we grow
[Line 174] the harder it is, because it means not merely learning by heart a great
[Line 175] many words, not merely training the palate and tongue to produce different sounds, but adopting a new attitude of mind.  Nothing definite has been discovered as to the localisation of faculties in the brain, therefore nothing certain is known; but it has always seemed to me and to others whom I have consulted that when you learn a new language you are exercising and developing a new piece of brain.  When you know several languages and change from one to another you seem
[Line 176] definitely to change the piece of brain which actuates your tongue. You switch off one centre and switch on to another.  You will always notice in yourself and others that there is a definite pause when the
[Line 177] change of language is made.  Now it becomes every year more difficult to awaken an unused part of the brain and bring it into active use, and to begin at twenty-three is late.  True, languages are taught them at Oxford before they come out, but the result seems _nil_.  You must
[Line 178] learn a language where it is spoken.  Moreover, the way they have been
[Line 179] taught Latin and Greek is a hindrance, for living languages are not learnt that way.  A child, for instance, learns to talk perfectly
[Line 180] without ever learning grammar.  I never heard that any great English
[Line 181] writer had a grounding in English grammar.  There is no real grammar of
[Line 182] a living language, because it grows and changes.  You can only have a
[Line 183] fixed grammar of a dead language. 
[Line 184] The fact is that correct talking is the outcome of correct thinking, not of any mechanical rules.  You must think in a language before you can speak it well.
[Line 185] But at twenty-three it is far too late for the ordinary man to learn to
[Line 186] think in Hindustani or Burmese or Tamil.  Of course there are
[Line 187] occasional exceptions, but the way these languages are usually spoken is dreadful.  I could tell tales about myself as well as others, for though I worked very hard for years I never knew Burmese well, nor yet
[Line 188] Canarese, nor yet Hindustani.  Yet who will doubt that it is very
[Line 189] important, the most important acquisition, in fact, that you can make? Without it you can never really get near the people.  So that in this way the old civilian had again a great advantage. 
[Line 190] Here is one story.  Once upon a time there was a District Officer and
[Line 191] there was his district, and for some reason they did not seem to agree.
[Line 192] At least the district did not like its Head.  It felt uneasy, and it
[Line 193] became restive, and at last it complained.  It took up many grievances, and amongst them was this: "There is a good deal of building wanted in various parts, and there is timber and there are sawyers, but no licences can be obtained.  When the Head comes round on tour we ask
[Line 194] him, but he always refuses.  So all building work is stopped." 
[Line 195] An Inspecting Officer went to inquire, and he began with this complaint: "Why do you refuse them sawpit licences when on tour?" he asked.
[Line 196] "I don't," the Head replied. 
[Line 197] "They say you do."
[Line 198]  "But they never even applied; so how could I refuse?" he answered.
[Line 199]  "Very well," said the Inspecting Officer, "let's see the file of your petitions received."  A clerk brought it out, and there--written in Burmese, of course--were many sawpit applications, and below each, written by the Head, was his
[Line 200] endorsement:
[Line 201]  "I cannot allow more guns to be issued."
[Line 202] Then the machine of government was far less perfected than it is now.
[Line 203] There were, of course, laws and rules and there was supervision, but to
[Line 204] nothing like the present extent.  The district officer then had a
[Line 205] personality.  He was required to have one, for local conditions differed more than they do now and he had far more latitude.  Moreover, the machine being less effective he depended a great deal upon his personal influence to keep the place quiet and get things done.  He
[Line 206] could not ask for orders because there was no telegraph, and he could
[Line 207] not get help quickly because there were no railways.  Therefore he was obliged to acquire a personal knowledge of people and peoples, of
[Line 208] individuals and castes and races, which, he thinks, is not so necessary
[Line 209] now.  The result was that all laws and orders passed through his personality before reaching the people, thus acquiring a humanity and reasonableness that is now impossible.  He studied his district and he used his powers, legal and otherwise, as he found best.  If he found a law harsh--and in the last resort all laws are so--he would ameliorate
[Line 210] its action.  Nowadays he cannot do that.  In the old days he administered, as best he could, justice; now he administers law--a very
[Line 211] wide difference.  Thus he was forced by circumstances to acquire a knowledge and a sympathy which are unattainable to-day; for you only
[Line 212] learn things by doing them.
[Line 213] The old district officers were known personally by name and by
[Line 214] reputation all through their districts.  The people looked to them for help and understanding, and protection as much against the rigidity and
[Line 215] injustice of the laws as against other ills.
[Line 216]  But nowadays, except the Government officials and headmen, I don't believe anyone in a district knows who the head is.  At all events, it makes practically no difference, because the application of the laws is supervised and enforced, and the district officer must "fall into line."  If any personality has survived his schooling it must now be
[Line 217] killed.
[Line 218] Few men, I think, learn anything except from two motives--a natural
[Line 219] driving desire or necessity.  But a natural desire to study the people round you is scarce, and the necessity of other days has passed away. A district officer can now do his work quite to the satisfaction of
[Line 220] Government and know next to nothing of the people.  In fact, sometimes
[Line 221] knowledge leads to remonstrance with Government, and it doesn't like that. 
[Line 222] Again, there has crept into secretariats a cult of "energy" and
[Line 223] "efficiency," and a definition of these words, which acts disastrously upon the district officer, both when he is under training and subsequently.
[Line 224]  Now, the proper meaning of an "efficient officer" is, I take it, one
[Line 225] who sees the right thing to do and does it quickly and effectively; and
[Line 226] probably Government really has this in its mind when it uses the word.
[Line 227] This is what it wants; but very often what it gets is almost the
[Line 228] opposite, and it is as pleased with this as if it got what it expected.
[Line 229] In fact, it does not seem to know the difference.  An example will explain what I mean.
[Line 230] There is, we will say, in a district a good deal of cattle theft going on, and the thieves cannot be detected.  Cattle graze in Burma in the fields, and in the jungle on their outskirts; they roam about a good deal, and it is easy enough to steal them; detection is difficult.
[Line 231] But there is in Burma, as in parts of India, a provision of the Village Regulation which is called the Track Law, and it is substantially as follows: 
[Line 232]  If cattle are missing their tracks can be followed.  When they pass out of the area under the jurisdiction of the village wherein the owner lives and enter another village lands, that village becomes responsible.  The tracker calls the headman of that village and shows him the tracks, which he must follow up and demonstrate that they have
[Line 233] not stopped in his jurisdiction but gone on.  In this way the tracks
[Line 234] can be followed till they are lost, when the village in whose land they
[Line 235] are lost is considered as being the village of the thief, and is therefore responsible for the lost cattle.  It can be fined, and the owner of the lost bullock indemnified. 
[Line 236]  This Act is taken from a very old custom common once in most of India,
[Line 237] and also, I believe, in places of Europe.  For several hundred years ago, when villages were widely separated by jungle, it had some sense. 
[Line 238] There was then a presumption either that the stolen bullock had been
[Line 239] taken to that village, or that some of the villagers had seen it pass. The thief would probably have stopped there for food or rest, as it was
[Line 240] a long way on.  But nowadays, in most of the country, village fields are conterminous, with little or no jungle between; there are many
[Line 241] roads, and except where the tracks actually go into the village gate
[Line 242] the presumption does not arise.  Cattle are common, and the villagers
[Line 243] are not expert trackers.  Moreover, there is a very strong premium on dishonesty, or at least carelessness in keeping to the right tracks.
[Line 244] Suppose the right track lost in a wet place, or a dry bare place, why
[Line 245] not pick up some other?  Most cattle tracks are very similar.  The owner wants his compensation.
[Line 246] Yet the "energetic" officer will be expected to work this Act _à pied de la lettre_. 
[Line 247] I saw a good deal of the actual working of this Act at one time, when I
[Line 248] was a subordinate officer.  Every time a beast was lost it had to be
[Line 249] tracked, and the village where the tracks were lost had to pay.  It
[Line 250] made no difference if there was any reasonable presumption against the village, there the law was.  The tracks might be lost two miles from
[Line 251] the actual village, simply crossing its boundary; the law was there.
[Line 252] I remember one village had a bad time because it was near a frequented
[Line 253] road, and when the tracks got on this road they were always lost, as
[Line 254] the surface was hard.  So the village had to pay.  Yet what evidence
[Line 255] was there against the village?  None.  I had the curiosity for some
[Line 256] time, whenever a case wherein a village was fined was subsequently detected, to find out what village had been fined, and see if that
[Line 257] village had been in any way cognisant of the theft.  It never had.  The fine was purely gratuitous, was worse than useless, for it was wrong. 
[Line 258] Yet it is a Government rule--not, I think, actually laid down, but understood--that whenever an offence occurs, unless the culprit is arrested a village must be held responsible.
[Line 259] I always disliked the Track Law and its subsidiary sections, not
[Line 260] because I have any objection to holding a village, in certain cases,
[Line 261] responsible for its members--I think it is a sound principle--but
[Line 262] because it always hit innocent people, as far as I could see.  I used
[Line 263] it as little as I could, yet there were difficulties.  I will mention a case in point.  There was a broker who lived not in my district but near its boundary,
[Line 264] and one day he rode to a village in my district to collect some debts. He didn't collect them, and left the village in a rage, saying he would
[Line 265] complain to the police-station six or seven miles away that he had been cheated.  It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when he left, and
[Line 266] he rode off across the plain in the direction of the police-station.
[Line 267] He was sighted at dusk near the river, going along a road which half a
[Line 268] mile farther on passed through a village, and no more was seen of him. He never arrived at the police-station, and next morning his pony was
[Line 269] found roaming the plain about the village near which he had last been seen.
[Line 270] There was no sign of him or his body. 
[Line 271] He was a well-known man, reputed to be wealthy, and a great fuss was
[Line 272] made.  His wife declared he must have been murdered.  The magistrate of the broker's district was indignant that "his" broker should have been murdered in my district and I do nothing.  My police could get no clue at all, nor could I.  A subordinate magistrate held a proceeding under the Track Law against the village where the broker disappeared, and
[Line 273] recommended it be fined.  I, however, held my hand.  Then a body was found floating in the river some miles lower down, and identified as the broker's body, and his wife gave it a funeral.  Still I held my hand. 
[Line 274] My neighbour was indignant; my Superintendent of Police was distressed
[Line 275] at me; my Commissioner evidently thought me slack--"no energy."  The
[Line 276] fact is I was puzzled, and would do nothing till I saw clearly.  So six months went on.  What would have happened eventually had nothing more come out I can't say, but something more did come out--the broker came out.  He was
[Line 277] recognised in Mandalay and immediately arrested--for pretending to be
[Line 278] alive when he was really dead, I suppose--and sent to me.  I asked him what had occurred, and he confessed that he was deeply in debt to money-lenders and had made up this scheme to defeat them.  He had left his pony, gone down to the river, crossed in a canoe, and gone into
[Line 279] hiding.  While he was "dead" his wife had compounded with his creditors.
[Line 280] I sent him back to my neighbour with the emphatic warning that if his broker ever came up my way again he would certainly be done for in good earnest.  The whole district had been turned upside down for him, and he was not popular.  Now the points that I wish all this to illustrate are these: Men at the head-quarters of Government, out of touch with real life, read the Track Law, think it most useful and just, and insist on its being enforced.  Officers on the spot, accustomed to accept all law as the
[Line 281] epitome of justice, follow the Act without thinking.  The responsibility is really on them, as Government tells them to judge each case on its merits, but they fear that if they reported that no
[Line 282] case under the Track Law ever had any merits they would be written down
[Line 283] as "wanting in energy."  As they have not been trained to think for themselves, they do not do so.  They fulfil all the requirements of the Act, and are satisfied.  Moreover, subsequently, to justify their own
[Line 284] action they must praise the Act.  Therefore a vicious circle is
[Line 285] created.  Government says: "District officers praise the Act, therefore have it stringently enforced, for they know its actual value."  And
[Line 286] district officers say: "Government declares this to be an admirable Act, therefore I must enforce it."  No one ever investigates the facts. If a district officer have doubts, he discreetly smothers them as babies, lest they grow.  And this is but one instance.  I mention in a later chapter a still
[Line 287] more striking case of this sort of action; and even many examples would
[Line 288] not expose its whole evil.  It is the spirit that renders such things possible that is disastrous.  So are officers trained to believe that
[Line 289] when anything untoward happens they must do something--they must punish
[Line 290] somebody.  The idea that if they act without full knowledge the
[Line 291] something they do will be wrong and the persons they punish will be
[Line 292] innocent is not allowed to intrude.  They will, of course, always act by law, but then, "_summum jus, summa injuria_."  In the old days this could not have happened.  In the first place, Government trusted its officers, and its trust was not misplaced; now it trusts its laws; yet
[Line 293] there is nothing so unintelligent, nothing so fatal as rigid laws--except those who believe in them.  In the second place, officers with the personality and knowledge of the men of former days would have insisted on seeing for themselves and judging for themselves.  They
[Line 294] would have cared nothing that they might be supposed not to have "energy."  They would know they had something better than that--they
[Line 295] had understanding.  The possibility of making our laws and our government generally endurable to the people depends on the personality of the district officer.
[Line 296]  Nowadays he is sent out with his personality crushed, and it gets still more crushed out there.  He becomes in time not a living soul but a
[Line 297] motor-engine to drive a machine.  Whatever knowledge he acquires is of the people's faults and not their virtues.  When you hear an official praised as "knowing the Indian" or "the Burman," you know that it means that he knows his faults.  He knows the criminal trying to escape, the
[Line 298] villager trying to evade revenue.  It doesn't mean that he knows more
[Line 299] than this.  Some do, especially among the police and the forest officers, but then they have no influence.
[Line 300] As showing the difference between the old officer and the new I make
[Line 301] the following extract from _A City of Sunshine_, by Alexander Allardyce.  Few books on the East have been written with a clearer understanding.
[Line 302] "Mr. Eversley, the collector, was an official of a type that has almost
[Line 303] passed away.  He had been brought up in the strictest traditions of the Haileybury school and had adhered all his life to the conservative principles of the 'old civilianism.'  When the 'Competition Wallah'
[Line 304] came in, Eversley foresaw certain ruin to the English interests in
[Line 305] India.  'Competition Wallahs!' he used to exclaim--'as well put the
[Line 306] country under a commission of schoolmasters at once.  But we'll lose
[Line 307] the country with all this Latin and Greek; take my word for it we'll
[Line 308] soon lose the country.'  Mr. Eversley had never been able to make a hexameter in the whole course of his life, and there is grave reason to doubt that he was ignorant of even the barest elements of the Greek accidence.  But he had acquired a marvellous colloquial familiarity with the Eastern vernaculars, and he knew the habits and feelings of
[Line 309] the Bengalee better than any other officer in the Lower Provinces.
[Line 310] There was no chance of Eversley falling into such a blunder as that which was laid to the charge of Muffington Prigge, the magistrate of the neighbouring district of Lallkor, who once, in taking the deposition of a witness in a criminal case, had expressed his displeasure that evidence of such importance should be given on the
[Line 311] authority of a third person, and ordered the police to bring 'Fidwi' before him.  The witness gave his evidence in the third person out of
[Line 312] respect.  Instead of saying 'I saw' he said 'Fidwi (your slave) saw.' Muffington Prigge's judgments had been more than once spoken of with
[Line 313] encomiums by Mr. Justice Tremer in the Appeal side of the High Court, but Mr. Eversley's law never came before the High Court except to be
[Line 314] reprobated.  Lawyers complained that he did not know even the rudiments
[Line 315] of the Codes; but there was no magistrate in the Lower Provinces whose decisions were received with more general satisfaction or from whose
[Line 316] judgments there were fewer appeals.  His rough-and-ready way of settling cases was better relished than the elaborate findings of the
[Line 317] Lallkor archon which were generally unintelligible to the suitors till
[Line 318] they had fee'd their lawyer to tell them which side had won.
[Line 319] "The people knew that Eversley would do what he saw to be right, independent of Act or Code, _and they had more confidence in his sense
[Line 320] of justice than in the written law_."  What is the highest praise a Burman will give to an officer--that he is clever, painstaking, honest, energetic, kind?  No; but that he has
[Line 321] "auza."  And what is "auza"?  It is that influence and power that comes
[Line 322] from personality.  Who has "auza" nowadays?  No one, not even Government.  It has become, as Eversley expected, a Commission of
[Line 323] Schoolmasters.
[Line 324]  
[Line 325] CHAPTER V
[Line 326] CRIMINAL LAW
[Line 327]  Let us turn now from the _personnel_ of government to its methods, from its men to its laws, from the motive power to the machine it works, or
[Line 328] which more often now works government.  The first subject that comes naturally to our view is the prevention
[Line 329] and suppression of crime, for in point of time that precedes all else. When you are conquering a country, after the soldiers have partly done their work and the civil power comes in, its first care is to create
[Line 330] and maintain peace.  It organises a police and appoints magistrates.
[Line 331] Thus in point of time the Criminal Courts are the first to be organised
[Line 332] and criminal law to be laid down, and they are the foundation-stone on
[Line 333] which all else is built.  And they remain always the most important of the functions of government.  If they work well, then there is a good
[Line 334] beginning made, but if ill, then the outlook is bad.  If what should be
[Line 335] Courts of Justice cease in the opinion of the people to be so, then is the very foundation-stone of your rule dissolving.  The whole edifice
[Line 336] is undermined; it is not founded on a rock, but on something that
[Line 337] decays, which soon will give way and let down everything.  Let us go back therefore to the beginning, and see how things worked then.  The laws were few, were crude, were often bad.  It must be
[Line 338] remembered that a hundred years ago the penal laws in England were the
[Line 339] most savage, the most useless, the most wicked the world has ever seen.
[Line 340] The law in India could not therefore be expected to be very good.  But
[Line 341] previous to our rule there was no law at all generally.  And these bad laws of ours came to the people through the medium of personalities who
[Line 342] were for the most part intelligent and sympathetic.  Moreover, there was nothing like the number of cases then as now.  The system now obliges all cognisable crime to be reported even if petty in its
[Line 343] nature.  In those days very little crime was reported, it was dealt
[Line 344] with by the village communities and never known to the Courts.  There
[Line 345] were few pleaders; and a trial was really what it ought to be, an
[Line 346] inquiry into facts by a magistrate desiring to know them.  The question
[Line 347] of personality came in a great deal, and whatever may be alleged of the ordinary district courts of those days, they were human, they really tried to be Courts of Justice, they tried to understand.  The people respected them.  If they did not respect the law, at all events they respected the magistrate who tried to do his best with it.  They had an
[Line 348] admiration for his personality which went a long way.  Now that is all changed.  The law has been greatly improved.  It has been codified by trained
[Line 349] legists; Lord Macaulay and Sir James Stephen were two of them, and it
[Line 350] is up to the standard of European codes.  But, on the other hand, it
[Line 351] has been made absolute.  There is a reign of law now, and there is no
[Line 352] person in the world who does not hate law when he sees it.  The personality that softened it in the old days has been ruled out.  The
[Line 353] High Courts supervise all work and reduce it to a dead level of
[Line 354] uniformity.  There is even a fixed scale of punishment sometimes.  On revision, cases are rejudged on the written evidence alone.  Of course,
[Line 355] the case cannot be altered on revision, but the magistrate can be
[Line 356] admonished--and he is.  All humanity is eliminated.  Therefore the Courts are despised and hated by the people, who misuse them in every way they can.
[Line 357]  Let us look into this matter. 
[Line 358] In the first place, let me explode a common fallacy.  It is frequently
[Line 359] said that Oriental people do not dislike crime, that they condone it,
[Line 360] that they have low standards in matters of current morality.  Therefore
[Line 361] they are not anxious to have crime brought to justice as we are.  They are a bad lot, and the criminal being but a trifle worse than the average they sympathise with him.
[Line 362] All that is wicked nonsense.  Standards in the East are the same as
[Line 363] they are elsewhere.  The people dislike crime as much as we do.  But they think our laws and Courts are not calculated to reduce crime, and they have good reason for so thinking.  Moreover, they distinguish between the sinner and his sin--we don't.  There lies the difference. Let us consider, therefore, the Courts and their relation to the people. 
[Line 364] I confine myself to the province of Burma which I know best, but there is little difference between it and other provinces in these matters. The law is uniform, the procedure uniform, and what differences exist
[Line 365] are due to interference of the High Courts acting within the law.  In
[Line 366] the Indian Penal Code are laid down definitions of the various
[Line 367] offences; what it is that constitutes theft, or robbery, or murder.  It
[Line 368] was drawn out by skilled and able men from the experience of all
[Line 369] civilised nations.  It is not, of course, perfect; no code could be that or near it, but it is good.  With most of it the people have no
[Line 370] quarrel.  A theft is the same anywhere, and so is a murder.  With one point, however, they profoundly disagree, and that is the classification of offences.  Theft, no matter how trivial, is an
[Line 371] offence against the State, is not compoundable, and is cognisable by the police; whereas an assault, no matter how severe, unless it causes
[Line 372] grievous hurt, is the opposite.  It is a purely private matter, with which the police have no business.  If the sufferer wants to prosecute he must do so himself; pay his own expenses and engage his own pleader,
[Line 373] or go without.  This is a difference that offends his own instinct. Just take two cases.
[Line 374] Your servant steals a little silver ornament, a few rupees you left about; or some hungry loafer takes some fruit off your tree.  You may
[Line 375] not forgive him, you may not overlook it.  You are bound by law to tell the police and get the offender arrested and convicted.  By the petty theft public morality has been outraged, and you must assist morality
[Line 376] to vindicate itself.  You have no option.  If you do not tell the police, you are "compounding a felony," and may be punished.  Having
[Line 377] told the police you will have no further trouble.  They will get up the case, look up evidence, summon the witnesses, prosecute the case, and
[Line 378] you will be paid for giving evidence.  The thief will be sent to gaol. But if your enemy meets you in the fields, knocks you down, rolls you
[Line 379] in the dust, dishonours and abases you in your own esteem and before
[Line 380] all who know of it, public morality is not offended.  It is of no use
[Line 381] going to the police-station; they will not listen to you, they will not
[Line 382] prosecute, nor take any notice.  If you desire justice you must go
[Line 383] yourself to Court, pay to have a petition written, pay for a stamp, get
[Line 384] an advocate and pay him, pay for summonses to witnesses, spend, say, three or four pounds, and eventually your enemy may be fined five
[Line 385] shillings, of which you, if lucky, may get two as compensation.  You
[Line 386] may, if you like, at any time withdraw your complaint, if, for
[Line 387] instance, your enemy apologises to you or compensates you.  Now these
[Line 388] are not selected cases, exaggerated cases, nor unusual cases.  They are
[Line 389] common, and in both cases the instincts of the people are outraged. They are not sordid-minded.  A petty theft is not to them a very serious thing.  They put a higher value on their personal dignity and self-respect than on a trifling piece of property.  To them, therefore, all this is wrong.  Theft is never a very deadly offence, and if of small things is easily forgiven.  _But they may not forgive_.  If the police hear of it, they must give evidence against the culprit--or must lie.  They lie.  Who blames them?  The concealment of thefts, the
[Line 390] refusal to report them to the police, the subsequent refusal to give
[Line 391] evidence, are common.  Is theirs the fault?  On the other hand, as it is impossible in the Courts to get any satisfaction for an assault, the hot-tempered Burman seeks revenge in other ways.  The Court fails him,
[Line 392] so he takes the law into his own hands.  He will waylay, will stab, will sometimes murder.  Then Government grieves over the large number of serious-hurt cases and wonders what causes them.  The wily Madrassi or Bengali coolie gets square in a different way.  The injured
[Line 393] complainant goes off straight to the police-station and there describes the assault more or less correctly.  This, of course, he knows will not help him, so he adds as follows: "During the assault a rupee dropped
[Line 394] out of my pocket, and when A had finished battering me he picked up the rupee and went off with it."  This makes the offence "theft," which is cognisable by the police, who go off and arrest B and lock him up.  Of course, at the trial the experienced magistrate detects the truth,
[Line 395] firmly disbelieves the rupee, and convicts A of an assault only.  But B is quite satisfied.  Has not A been locked up for a week? 
[Line 396] The perspective therefore of the Indian Penal Code is wrong.  It is
[Line 397] taken from English law, which is also wrong, that is, opposed to common sense.  How it arose I know, but this is not the place to enter into
[Line 398] that.  Therefore the very definition and classification of offences are repugnant to the people, and are themselves causes of evasion: the Indian Penal Code itself is wrong.  But that is nothing to the wrong-headedness of the Criminal Procedure Code.
[Line 399]  For whereas the Penal Code only partly offends the people, the Court procedure is wrong from top to bottom.  Its very foundation principle
[Line 400] is wrong.  What is its principle of a trial?  Is it a means of finding out the
[Line 401] truth?  Is it an impartial inquiry into what has happened?  Not in the least.  A trial is a duel.  It is the lineal descendant of the duels of the Middle Ages.  The place is changed, it is a Court and not a field;
[Line 402] weapons are witnesses and tongues, not swords nor spears; the parties fight by champions, not in person, and the umpire is called a judge,
[Line 403] but the principle is the same.  Take any criminal trial.  On one side
[Line 404] is the Crown prosecutor, on the other the advocate of the accused. They fight.  All through the case they fight.  The prosecutor calls his witnesses, asks them only the questions the answers to which will help
[Line 405] his case.  The other champion cross-examines, bullies, confuses them, tries to make them contradict themselves, drags in irrelevant matter, and tries to destroy what the other side has built.  When the defence is on, the state of affairs is reversed.  Neither wants the truth, and only the truth, and all the truth.  Each plays to win, and that alone.
[Line 406] If either knows evidence which would help the other side he suppresses
[Line 407] it.  The judge is almost helpless.  He has to take what is given.  He sees _lacunae_ in the evidence, he cannot fill them.  He can't get down from off the bench and go out into the country finding evidence for
[Line 408] himself.  He knows that every witness brought before him has been
[Line 409] tutored--not directly perhaps, but indirectly by suggestion, by
[Line 410] question, by influence.  The case is cooked before it reaches him, and
[Line 411] therefore hopeless.  He knows he never finds out the exact truth about
[Line 412] any single thing.  How should he?  He knows and sees that witnesses are
[Line 413] lying.  He knows the reason, because it is a duel, and they are, on one
[Line 414] side or another, fighting for vengeance, fighting for liberty.  He
[Line 415] knows that though they are a singularly truthful people outside, yet inside, their consciences absolve them from the necessity of truth because the Court is so constituted as not to be a place for an inquiry
[Line 416] into truth, but the arena of a duel.  He sees cases bought and sold.  A clever barrister or advocate will
[Line 417] secure an acquittal where a cheaper man would fail.  That is notorious
[Line 418] everywhere.  Otherwise how do great barristers come by their big fees?
[Line 419] Clients do not pay for nothing.  A barrister is worthy of his hire. The poor man loses and the rich man wins.  The poor man goes to gaol, the rich is acquitted or gets a light sentence.  So it happens everywhere.  The exact truth of a case is never known.  For twenty
[Line 420] years I was a magistrate and judge.  I tried hundreds of cases and I
[Line 421] did my best with each.  But I never once reached my own standard of understanding.  What is that standard?  Not that of Courts of Appeal
[Line 422] who generally upheld my cases.  My standard was this: Do I know enough
[Line 423] of the case to write a story embodying it if I wanted to?  I never did. For the standard of truth that goes to even the slightest story is very
[Line 424] far beyond what is required or possible in even the most carefully heard case. 
[Line 425] Now this is not an edifying state of things.  It is not edifying
[Line 426] anywhere, and I have often heard remarks about it in England from men
[Line 427] who happened into a court of law to hear a case.  To judges, lawyers, and barristers this view of the proceedings does not occur, because
[Line 428] they have been brought up to it, and therefore their minds are locked as far as really appreciating it goes.  In India and Burma it is even
[Line 429] less edifying.  I have often heard Burmans talk of it.  "Here on one
[Line 430] side are the police, trained men, with all the power and resource of a great Government behind them, trying to get a conviction.  They have gone about the country, searched out evidence, tested it, summoned it,
[Line 431] and displayed it to its best effect in Court.  On the other side is a
[Line 432] poor devil of a villager who has been locked up while the police were
[Line 433] free; who is poor, who is ignorant, who if he can afford a pleader at
[Line 434] all can only afford a very indifferent one.  His case is not presented
[Line 435] at all, or is very badly presented.  True, the case has to be clearly
[Line 436] proved or he is acquitted, but the same facts may wear very different colours, according to whether the whole truth is known or only a half.
[Line 437] The magistrate does his best, but he can only act on the evidence.  The police want a conviction because otherwise their records are bad and promotion is stopped.  Do you wonder that sympathy is often with the
[Line 438] accused?"
[Line 439]  So I have often been asked; and I don't wonder.  I often felt that way
[Line 440] myself.
[Line 441]  When a man first falls into an offence his immediate instinct is to
[Line 442] confess to somebody.  That is true of all the world.  In Burma at the
[Line 443] beginning he used to confess to the Court.  He was sorry for his
[Line 444] offence, he wanted to make the best of it, wanted help to reform.  He
[Line 445] wanted understanding.  He thought the Court wanted to know the truth and he would do all he could to help.  But he very soon found the
[Line 446] uselessness of this.  He got no understanding, no sympathy, only conviction and a vindictive punishment.  Naturally he reflected, and
[Line 447] pleaders and people who knew the Courts helped him to reflect.
[Line 448]  "Fight it out.  At worst you can but lose and be no worse off than if you confessed.  Why tell the truth?  _No one expects you to_.  If you
[Line 449] have confessed withdraw your confession.  Say you were tortured.  A trial is a fight, with the judge as umpire.  Do your best.  Remember
[Line 450] that, even if your offence be a very small one, if it is a cognisable
[Line 451] offence you will be ruined for life if convicted."  That is the advice
[Line 452] he gets.  Who will doubt but that, our Courts being what they are, it
[Line 453] is sound as a rule?  So, because it is a fight he won't confess; he plays for the big stake--acquittal; and sometimes this acts disastrously too.  I will tell a case in point--one I tried myself.  A man was accused of maiming a bullock.  It had trespassed into his
[Line 454] Indian-corn field, and had been found there afterwards hamstrung, and had to be destroyed.  It was proved that accused was in the field when
[Line 455] the bullock wandered in.  It was also proved that accused's chopper was
[Line 456] found close to the maimed bullock, covered with blood.  Accused had run away and had only been arrested some days later.  Now the malicious maiming of a valuable bullock is a serious offence. Its seriousness partly depends on the value of the animal.  The case was quite clearly proved though no one actually saw the offence committed.  The defence of the accused was a futile _alibi_.  He had a pleader who arranged this.  The evidence for the prosecution seemed
[Line 457] quite clear, and I did not see how I could avoid convicting the man of the grave offence.  Yet somehow I was not quite happy in my mind.  I believed the prosecution was substantially true, but that they had been
[Line 458] piling it on a good deal.  So before adjourning the case till next day to give me time to write the judgment, I said to the accused: 
[Line 459] "I don't believe your _alibi_.  You can see for yourself it has no
[Line 460] sense.  But maybe if you told me your side of the story it might not
[Line 461] look so bad for you as it does now." 
[Line 462] He looked at me, hesitated, looked at his pleader, then all of a sudden
[Line 463] he did bring the whole story out.  And as he told it, though it did not in any way invalidate the evidence for the prosecution, it did put the matter in quite a new light.
[Line 464]  In the first place, the cattle, of which the bullock was one, had been
[Line 465] wilfully driven into his field to annoy him and cause him loss.  In the
[Line 466] second place, he had not deliberately cut the bullock; when he saw the
[Line 467] cattle coming through the six-foot-high corn towards him he had in a
[Line 468] passion thrown his chopper at the dimly seen moving mass of cattle. Then he had dodged out of their way.  When he found afterwards what damage he had done he ran away in a fright. 
[Line 469] I found there was evidence to support what he said--for instance, he
[Line 470] had gone straight home and told his father before he ran away--so he
[Line 471] got off with a small fine.  He might have got two years.  But unless he
[Line 472] had confessed I could never have guessed that there was quite another version of the facts. 
[Line 473] Now I have often suspected this state of affairs.  The substance of the prosecution is clear, but there might be extenuating circumstances. The accused however fights it to the last and will admit nothing.  On
[Line 474] the evidence I could but take a gloomy view; for, remember, all cases are subject to revision by the High Court, who simply read through the
[Line 475] written evidence and are not able to appreciate the subtle effect of tone and manner in witnesses, which tell more sometimes than their words.  I have said that the people have no respect for the Courts because they
[Line 476] have lost all respect for the magistrate or judge.  In himself he may
[Line 477] be worthy of all confidence; but when on the bench he is not himself,
[Line 478] he is a mouthpiece of the law, or an umpire; he is not a living force.
[Line 479] When you lie in Court you do not deceive a human being who is doing his
[Line 480] best for you and others; you only try to counterbalance the injustice
[Line 481] of the law by a little judicious weighting of the scales.  A man who
[Line 482] will tell you the truth as individual to individual will commit perjury
[Line 483] before you in Courts and think nothing of it.  In fact, he lies at the
[Line 484] other side, and doesn't consider you at all.  He does it to try to get justice, or what he thinks is justice, in place of law, which otherwise is all he would get.  I have often been told this, and I notice the
[Line 485] same in England.  Truth is a relationship of persons; in a Court now the only persons are the two opponents; the judge is only a sort of
[Line 486] machine to weigh evidence.  As man to man I have found Orientals as
[Line 487] truthful as Englishmen.  In twenty-six years' experience I do not
[Line 488] remember ever having been told a deliberate lie as man to man.  But in the Courts you are not a man, you are an official, and even as an
[Line 489] official your hands are tied.  The parties have no direct relationship with you.  Their relationship is with each other--just as in a duel or
[Line 490] a prize-fight the relationship is between party and party, and the
[Line 491] umpire is only the onlooker, who may or may not see most of the game. In law he usually sees less because Justice is blind.  I am aware that
[Line 492] the bandage over the eyes of Justice is supposed to render her just, not discriminating between rich and poor; it does the reverse, of course.  And until Justice opens her eyes again to discriminate what is
[Line 493] put into her scales she will remain the mock she now is. 
[Line 494] In a previous book I have discussed the question of veracity in this connection, and lest anyone should object that what I say is true only of the Burmese I will add this story, which is of a well-known official in the North-West in his younger days.
[Line 495] He was inquiring into a Revenue case, and incidentally an Indian
[Line 496] gentleman gave him certain information.  The official thought this so important that he summoned the Indian to Court, where, much to the Englishman's surprise, the Indian as a witness gave a totally different story.
[Line 497] They met again, however, later, and the official asked the Indian gentleman what he meant by going back on his words like that.  The
[Line 498] latter smiled, hesitated, and then the wisdom of experience spoke to
[Line 499] the altruism of ignorance in these words: "Sahib," he said, "you are very young."  How the Courts are generally regarded by the people can best be illustrated by giving an account of a dramatic entertainment I
[Line 500] witnessed once.  The Burmese are fond of the drama.  They have old dramas, and they have new dramas up to date--satires for the most part.
[Line 501] The play I saw was of the latter.  The company was a well-known one,
[Line 502] which had toured almost all the province, and its most famous piece was
[Line 503] that I witnessed--I forget the name.  The scene was supposed to be the office of a lawyer, barrister, or
[Line 504] advocate, and there was a native clerk.  To him entered a would-be
[Line 505] litigant.  The clerk listens to him for a few minutes and then asks him if he has brought any money.  The client says "No."  The clerk rises in
[Line 506] indignation and the client is hustled out.
[Line 507]  He returns with a bag of money.  The clerk then listens and the client explains his case.  The clerk demands if there is any evidence.  The client is puzzled and asks what evidence is required.  The clerk then
[Line 508] tells him slowly and distinctly: you must have a man to swear to this, another to swear to that, a third to swear to something else.  The client remonstrates, saying he doubts if he can get so much evidence.  The clerk then tells him that if he cannot get the evidence demanded his master will not take up his case.  "But," says the client indignantly, "it is a true case."  "What does that matter?" asks the
[Line 509] clerk cynically.  "No Court cares--or can tell if it did care--whether
[Line 510] your case is true or not.  It can only tell if you have evidence or
[Line 511] not.  If you can't get the evidence your case may be the truest in the
[Line 512] world, but that won't help you." 
[Line 513] The client then wants his money back, but the clerk clings to the bag and the client is again thrown out.  The play was a long one, and I can
[Line 514] only give a résumé of parts of it.  The client goes looking for witnesses in the village.  He gets hold of one man and says: "Come and
[Line 515] give evidence."  "But I saw nothing," says the villager.  "And," says the client indignantly, "would you let me, an old friend, lose what you know is a right cause just because you didn't happen to see a trifle
[Line 516] like that?  What does it matter if you didn't actually see it?  It did happen.  I am not asking you to tell a lie or invent anything."
[Line 517] So he gets his witnesses and takes them to the clerk.  The clerk takes
[Line 518] down their statements.  The last scene is in Court, and the client's
[Line 519] advocate appears to plead for him.  He does so with a tongue two feet
[Line 520] in length.  But still he loses his case, for the advocate on the other
[Line 521] side has a tongue three feet long.  That this play was the success it proved to be shows clearly that the audience saw nothing unnatural in it.  In fact, they relished it immensely. 
[Line 522] The magistrate was a stuffed figure.  
[Line 523]  
[Line 524] CHAPTER VI
[Line 525]  PENAL LAW  There is a further difference in their view of crime, between
[Line 526] Englishmen as they are made by education and Orientals who in some ways
[Line 527] remain the natural man, which greatly affects the Courts, that is the
[Line 528] punishment due for crime.
[Line 529] In England we have had the most cruel penal laws ever known.  It is not a hundred years ago that there were two hundred and twenty-three
[Line 530] different offences for which the capital punishment was awarded.  I wonder if people nowadays ever realise their horrors.  I have an
[Line 531] account of how a poor little servant girl convicted of having stolen
[Line 532] some few clothes was dragged out half-dead with fear to a gibbet without the village and there slowly done to death before a crowd of people.  It was no unusual thing, for theft of over five shillings was punishable with death.  The record of our Courts in England is the most
[Line 533] brutal and most bloody in history.  They have been reformed but very
[Line 534] partially.  There is still amongst Englishmen a vindictiveness towards
[Line 535] the criminal that is unknown elsewhere.  Despite frequent denunciation of the uselessness and the wickedness of vindictive punishment, the
[Line 536] idea continually recurs.  It is not merely excused--it is even counted
[Line 537] as righteousness by those who maintain it.  Now it would be impossible here to give a full analysis of the cause of
[Line 538] this vindictiveness.  It has many causes.  It is not natural, but caused by education.  But a principal one lies in our theology.  A theology that predicates a God who devotes poor mortals He made to
[Line 539] torture by fire for ever, simply for the fun of watching them suffer, has elevated cruelty, uselessness, and vindictiveness into a divine attribute.  Therefore men may be excused and even praised for imitating their God as far as in them lies.  The East is free from any such theology.  I am not an admirer of any of the theories at the base of its religions, but, at all events, none of
[Line 540] them have sunk to such a depth as this.  Therefore the Oriental thought
[Line 541] is free in this matter to discern the truth.
[Line 542]  And further, even the ordinary villagers are deeper psychologists than we are.  How this comes about I am not sure; by the free life of the children I think mainly.  But however it comes there is no doubt of the
[Line 543] fact, for it has been widely noticed.  They are very quick at gauging character, in weighing virtues and defects, at seeing in effects the causes.  Thus, all throughout the East the fatality that runs through life has been seen; it has even passed into a saying.  By fatality, of course, is not meant that God fore-ordains all events, but that every
[Line 544] act has its antecedent, that it never stands alone but is the outcome of the past.  There has been endless discussion in Europe on this question, but to the East the matter presents itself in very simple guise.  No man has the choice of when he is born, into what sort of a
[Line 545] physique, of what parents or country.  Neither has he any control over how he is brought up, whether educated or not.  Thus he himself is to a very great extent a creature not of his own will but of what we may
[Line 546] call Fate.  He has, moreover, no control over his environment; he did not make the laws, the customs, nor the religion, which surround him.
[Line 547] Many of his acts are done under the authority of others--parents,
[Line 548] teachers, masters, government; others are the inevitable result of the environment (which he did not make) acting on his personality (which he
[Line 549] did not make).  There is also chance--as we call it; sudden temptation for instance.  Therefore his ability to exercise freewill in act is
[Line 550] small, and to hold him personally responsible for all his acts is absurd.  Especially is this the case with crime.  No one originally
[Line 551] wants to commit crime; if he fall into it, his "will" is not usually to blame.  A famine will cause a great deal of crime; the criminals did
[Line 552] not make the famine.  An unusual strain was put on them, and they were
[Line 553] not able to stand the strain.  Everyone is a potential criminal--given
[Line 554] the circumstances.  It is more than probable that everyone has at one
[Line 555] time or another committed some offence.  This is well known in the
[Line 556] East, for they think there a great deal more than is supposed.  They
[Line 557] have not been educated not to think yet.  I have myself discussed this
[Line 558] point with many Orientals, and I have found that this clear view of the
[Line 559] causation of crime is not unusual.  Even if the matter has not been thought out there is an instinctive differentiation between a criminal
[Line 560] and his crime.  They, as I have said before, hate crime, but that shrinking from the criminal so common with us is not so marked with
[Line 561] them. 
[Line 562] Thus they have long ago seen the futility of attributing crime to a defect of the individual will; they know it is due to much deeper, wider causes.  They have also seen the very narrow limits within which
[Line 563] punishment avails.  Therefore our punishments shock them by their cruelty.  Ordinary cattle are worth from twenty to fifty shillings a
[Line 564] head, and they roam about the forest on the outskirts of the fields
[Line 565] almost unguarded.  Yet the theft of one is punishable always with two years' rigorous imprisonment; that is to say, the man is vindictively
[Line 566] and uselessly punished, is turned into a confirmed criminal and ruined for life for failing at a momentary temptation.  I have known cases
[Line 567] where a man was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude for stealing a few rupees--a piece of savagery that the Court sought to justify by the
[Line 568] fact that the man had committed several previous petty thefts.  Of course, the reason of his repeated crime was the man's inability to earn a livelihood and exercise self-control.  He should have been
[Line 569] taught and helped--not sent to penal servitude.  So are the instincts
[Line 570] of the people outraged.
[Line 571]  I wonder how many people there are in this world who have not committed
[Line 572] some criminal offence; few I should think, and those not the most useful of mankind.  I have just been reading of Mark Twain's boyhood, and how, besides "borrowing" many articles, he and his friend "hooked"
[Line 573] a boat, painted it red so that the owner should not recognise it, and
[Line 574] kept it.
[Line 575]  For that in England a hundred years ago he could and probably would
[Line 576] have been hanged if caught.  In Burma to-day he _might_, after
[Line 577] conviction, be let off under the first offender sections, but he would
[Line 578] most probably be sent to a reformatory.  Yet who thinks the worse of Mark Twain for it?  We think we have reformed our laws and made them common-sense, but we have not.  They are still wicked beyond computation.
[Line 579] In _The Soul of a People_, and in I think every book since, I have
[Line 580] animadverted upon the uselessness and cruelty of our penal system. When a man has committed a crime, what do we do?  Find out the weakness which led to it and cure that weakness--turn him out a whole and healthy man again?  No.  We make him worse.  We make a confirmed
[Line 581] criminal of him.  Is that sense, to say nothing of humanity?  A man who
[Line 582] has committed a theft is not past cure; a man who has been in gaol
[Line 583] generally is.  The people see this clearly enough--that in helping to
[Line 584] get a man convicted they are not improving matters for themselves.  The offender will come out of gaol a more dangerous character to his
[Line 585] village than when he went in.  For they go back to their village; they are not thrown loose in a great city as in England.  If in England an
[Line 586] offender on his release had to be accepted back into his community, the uselessness of our penal system would soon come home to the public.
[Line 587] But we have no communities now in England, only an amorphous herd of voters.  All this, however, is clear enough to the East.  Therefore they often
[Line 588] won't report their losses.  They would sooner submit to the small monetary loss than have it on their consciences that they have ruined a man for life.  And all for what?  Not even to rescue what they have lost, for the bullock is usually dead and eaten, and no compensation is ever given.  The quantity of reported crime in Burma is bad enough, but what would
[Line 589] it be if all crimes were reported?  Double, I should think.  I have known innumerable cases in my own experience where no report was made
[Line 590] even of serious offences for this reason.  One was a case of attempted murder.
[Line 591]  Thus there is a great and dangerous gap between the people and the
[Line 592] Courts, and there is no way of bridging it.  In England also there is that gap, but it is not so wide, and there are juries who can partly
[Line 593] bridge it.  In Burma, practically speaking, for Burmans trial by jury does not exist.  There is nothing between the accused and the rigid
[Line 594] injustice of the laws.  The judge and the magistrate are helpless; they must follow the law or be pulled up by the High Court.  But a jury need
[Line 595] not give its reasons; its future does not depend on the Appellate Court; it is independent, and therein lies its strength and its usefulness.  It is juries that put common sense into laws and Courts. 
[Line 596] Here is a case in point where Europeans were concerned.  There was a certain big firm, and one day it discovered that it had lost certain sums of money--not very large.  It could not find out how the loss had occurred; the partners inquired in secret, but could find no evidence. However, they suspected their cashier.  They knew he was hard up; they
[Line 597] heard he had been gambling.  But they had no proof.  What did they do?
[Line 598] Amend their system of accounts and supervision to prevent loss in the
[Line 599] future?  No.  They laid a trap.  They put a large sum within their cashier's reach in such a way that it would seem he could take it--at any rate for a short time--with safety.  He took it, and they
[Line 600] prosecuted him.  The case, I think, was clear, but to the astonishment of the judge, the jury acquitted the cashier.  They gave no reasons, of
[Line 601] course, in Court.  They simply said "Not guilty," and there was an end;
[Line 602] but once out of Court they were not so silent.
[Line 603] "Why did we acquit?  Because the firm laid a trap.  They deliberately tempted him, knowing him to be hard up.  He was not charged with taking the first small sums, and in our belief he never took them.  Probably
[Line 604] he took the last big sum.  But why?  Because they tempted him.  The
[Line 605] firm were accessory, they were abettors of the crime.  Of course we
[Line 606] acquitted."
[Line 607]  And I think the general common sense of the community was with them.
[Line 608] No one has a right to tempt to crime and prosecute if the crime occurs. But had accused been a Burman he would have got seven years without a
[Line 609] doubt.  The Englishman got justice, a Burman would have got only law.
[Line 610] The Burmans are not blind, do not suppose it; they see this difference
[Line 611] well enough.  Nothing could demonstrate more conclusively how utterly out of touch with the people the Courts are, how useless in preventing crime, than the fact that every year Government in despair prosecutes, and either holds to heavy security, or sends to gaol with hard labour for from six
[Line 612] months to two years (mainly two years), over two thousand persons who
[Line 613] are not only not convicted of any offence, but _are not accused of any offence_.  The exact number in 1910 was 2143.  This is done under the Preventive sections of the Criminal Procedure Code, and anything more unjust, more useless, more provocative of crime than this misuse of the sections it is impossible to imagine.  The legitimate use of these preventive sections is simple enough.  They are
[Line 614] to meet the case of the police hearing that a crime, say a robbery, is being planned, and that to prevent its occurring, the would-be criminals may be called on by a magistrate to find security to be of
[Line 615] good behaviour.  But such cases are rare and the sections are misused.  There are
[Line 616] general circulars in force obliging magistrates and police to use these
[Line 617] sections to their utmost.  When officers are on tour they are enjoined to demand at each village they visit if there are any idle or doubtful characters about, and if so, to prosecute them.  Pressure is brought to bear on headmen to produce such characters, and they do produce--everyone they have reason to dislike.
[Line 618]  The evidence is all hearsay.  Here is a summary:  _Question by Police_: Do you know Accused?  _Answer by Headman_: Yes.  _Q_.  What sort of character has he? 
[Line 619] _Ans_.  A bad character. 
[Line 620] _Q_.  What sort of bad character?
[Line 621]  _Ans_.  Well, when B.'s headcloth was missing last year, Accused was supposed to have taken it.  _Q_.  You therefore consider him a thief?
[Line 622] _Ans_.  Yes. 
[Line 623]  Three such witnesses, and if Accused cannot find substantial security,
[Line 624] away he goes to hard labour for two years.  This has gone on for the last twenty years.  In 1910 one judge has actually opened his eyes wide
[Line 625] enough to see that it is a way of manufacturing criminals, and the High Court go so far as to have "misgivings."  But there it ends.
[Line 626] There are in Burma now probably 60,000 or more men who have been
[Line 627] deliberately made into criminals by Government.  No wonder crime is bad.
[Line 628]  What is to be done?  The Indian people have clamoured for trial by jury of their peers--that is their fellow-countrymen--but it has always been refused.  Government
[Line 629] does not say why--but the reason is well known--it is because it fears
[Line 630] that juries would invariably acquit.  And that fear is probably justified.  Judging from what assessors do I should say it was fully justified.  They would acquit.  But does not this very fact indicate
[Line 631] that the law and the people are at variance?  It most emphatically does
[Line 632] not mean that the Orientals condone crime; it means that they think
[Line 633] that crime is now wrongly dealt with.  There was a period in England
[Line 634] when juries would not convict.  Why?  Because they condoned crime?  No, but because the punishments were too brutal; and the law had to be altered till their consciences were satisfied.  That was the way the old penal laws came to be amended.  When juries won't convict it is because their consciences are being outraged in some way.  Has any attempt ever been made to discover in what way our Courts in India now
[Line 635] outrage the people's consciences?  Never to my knowledge.  There has been the fixed idea that our system is perfect, therefore blame the
[Line 636] people.  "They must have Oriental minds which no one can understand."
[Line 637]  The Indian Penal Code is the principal law relating to offences and
[Line 638] punishments, but there are many minor laws and all are defective in the
[Line 639] same way--that they have been framed out of some inner consciousness,
[Line 640] and not out of practical knowledge.
[Line 641] Take the Gambling Acts in Burma.  The Burmese are a cheerful people, and, like other cheerful human beings, they like their game of chance
[Line 642] sometimes.  When it becomes a public nuisance, of course it must be checked, no one doubts that; but the Gambling Acts go much farther than that.  The people have not a great variety of games, and their
[Line 643] principal card game is a sort of bank.  It can, of course, become a big gamble, but it can also be as innocent as penny loo.  Nevertheless, it is always illegal because there is a banker.  That is the way the Act
[Line 644] is framed.  So if five or six villagers gather in the evening for a game at penny loo they can be raided, tried, and fined or imprisoned.
[Line 645] I had a Burmese subordinate magistrate once who was not only a very "energetic" officer but a very religious officer, and he determined to
[Line 646] stop all this "pernicious gambling" in his township.  He established a
[Line 647] "terror," so to speak.  He had censors everywhere, and if a schoolboy tossed another double or quits for a farthing, the law was after them. 
[Line 648] I could not stop him because he had the law behind him, but every month
[Line 649] I sent for all his gambling cases on revision, and I quashed them all. There wasn't any Appellate Court behind me in those matters and I had a
[Line 650] free hand.  Finally, as he wouldn't take a hint, I got my too energetic assistant transferred to other fields of usefulness.
[Line 651] It doesn't look well for Englishmen to play bridge and other games of
[Line 652] cards for money in their Clubs and bungalows while the Burmese are
[Line 653] totally debarred.  It smacks of self-righteousness.  A good deal of our rule does that now, and it does not tend to make it popular.  In human affairs there are a time and a place for things, but in law there is only the absolute.  Now the absolute is wrong.  And if there is one
[Line 654] quality above another that is detestable it is self-righteousness.  Our
[Line 655] laws tend to self-righteousness; our judges and officials are very liable to succumb to that tendency.  It is bad for a man to have to
[Line 656] deal continually with the seamy side of human nature; he can only keep his mind sweet by continual touch with the other side.  But in India
[Line 657] and Burma the ordinary official knows nothing of the other side.  He has no dealing with the people except in an official capacity.  He
[Line 658] knows nothing of their ordinary life, their work, or their amusements. He does not take an interest in the staple industries of his villages, nor in the amusements of the people.  Therefore he cannot see how bad the laws are because he judges them _a priori_ and not in relation to
[Line 659] their effects on the people.  The Indian Penal Code he knows, the accused and the witnesses he does not know; the Village Act he knows,
[Line 660] the village organism he is hopelessly ignorant of.  Therefore when Government pass and enforce laws that do more harm than good he cannot
[Line 661] tell them what is wrong.  Naturally, he must believe nothing is wrong.  Yet the whole Penal System of India is wrong.  It is very wrong indeed.
[Line 662] I believe I could keep a district in greater quietness and peace if its Criminal Courts were abolished altogether and I were allowed to use the
[Line 663] village organism in its proper form for preventing crime.  For the essential truth in dealing with crime, as with disease, is that it can be prevented but can rarely be cured.  However, I do not mean to say that Criminal Courts, if they administered good laws and were reasonably constituted, are bad things.  They will in time be to crime what hospitals are to diseases: places where the sufferer goes to have
[Line 664] his illness diagnosed and cured so that he come out a clean man whom
[Line 665] the community will be glad to welcome back.  That a man who has once
[Line 666] been in gaol is for ever a social leper is the strongest condemnation a system of criminal justice could receive. 
[Line 667] As things are now the people hate the Courts; they hate the law, all of
[Line 668] it.  It must not be supposed that, because I have pointed out only
[Line 669] certain defects, all the rest is satisfactory.  That is very far from
[Line 670] being the case.  But my object is not to criticise the laws or Courts exhaustively.  I only want to dissipate the complacency that regards
[Line 671] them as perfect and the people alone to be blameworthy.  There is no
[Line 672] one who more dislikes pointing out deficiencies than I do.  If I could I would never write anything but pleasant things.  But that is
[Line 673] impossible.  An imminent danger hangs over our Indian Empire, and so
[Line 674] our own future and its can only be secured by facing the truth.  If Indian officials on the spot would open their eyes and see things as they are there would be no cause to write--but they will not.
[Line 675]  
[Line 676] CHAPTER VII 
[Line 677] THE CIVIL COURTS
[Line 678]  We come now to the Civil Courts, wherein all suits relating to
[Line 679] property, to inheritance, and to money are tried.
[Line 680]  I have already referred to the archaic state in which, all over India,
[Line 681] matters of marriage and inheritance remain; no change has taken place
[Line 682] during our rule, nor could do so.  Except in Burma, all these matters
[Line 683] are connected with religion, and although people when in a progressive state will themselves not hesitate to break through fetters of religion and custom, they will never allow a foreign Government to do so.  Our Government interferes already in a great many matters it had better
[Line 684] leave alone, and to lay a sacrilegious finger on domestic concerns would cause instant antagonism.  It is not our business.  Is Government
[Line 685] thus to intrude into the very home?  You can imagine the howl there would be, and rightly.  We must not touch them, and the people,
[Line 686] disorganised as they are, cannot touch them; so there they remain.
[Line 687] In a previous book I have referred to the Burmese law that no one may
[Line 688] make a will, and to its effect in preventing Burmans building up a business.  Moreover, the law of inheritance is so doubtful sometimes that when a rich Burman dies his estate usually goes into Court and, naturally, does not come out again.  This is very unsatisfactory, but until there is some real self-government I see no help for it.  On a
[Line 689] matter of this kind it is of no use collecting the opinions of any
[Line 690] number of Burmans as to what should be done, and so passing an Act.  It
[Line 691] is a fact to which I shall have to revert later that men as individuals
[Line 692] will give an opinion, which if combined into an assembly with authority
[Line 693] to act they would greatly modify.  Moreover, if our Government were
[Line 694] responsible, individuals would urge action, which if they themselves were responsible they would not take.  No advice that is not steadied by a sense of responsibility is of much value.  Our Government cannot deal with such matters.  Only a body representing Burmese opinion and responsible to that opinion could do it.  There is not now any prospect
[Line 695] of any such body.  The present Councils are useless.  There may be such a body in course of time, but until there is, matters must remain as they are.  The result is discontent, naturally. 
[Line 696] Take another similar point.  In Upper Burma a good deal of the land is what is called ancestral land; that is to say, in private hands.  Now there was amongst the people a great pride in holding land their
[Line 697] ancestors held, and such land is very rarely sold.  I am not quite sure that it can be sold.  Neither is it mortgaged in the usual sense.  What the owner does is to hand the land over to a mortgagee for a sum of money.  He pays no interest on the debt because the mortgagee enjoys
[Line 698] the land.  Such a transaction is called a usufructuary mortgage.  The
[Line 699] owner can at any time redeem the land by repaying the original loan. In Burmese time there was no period of limitation, but our Limitation
[Line 700] Act has imposed a limit of sixty years.  Thus a man may hand over a
[Line 701] piece of land to a mortgagee, go off to Lower Burma--as many have--and at any time within sixty years he or his heirs can redeem the land for the same sum.  Consider what this means.  I am the mortgagee of a piece of land.  If I
[Line 702] improve it so that its value is increased the owner can come back, borrow money to redeem it, and re-mortgage it for double the amount next day to someone else.  Therefore I certainly won't improve it.  I
[Line 703] can't sell it.  I can work it of course.  I have also to defend my title every now and then from attack.  It may be that the original
[Line 704] mortgagor did not own the land at all.  He may have simply been the member of the family in whom the occupation was vested.  The other members can challenge my right.  They do.  And this sort of thing can
[Line 705] go on for sixty years.  That is not the sort of law to encourage
[Line 706] progress.  It encourages litigation, but that is all.  The whole country groans under it naturally.  But before any relief could be
[Line 707] given there would have to be some consensus of opinion among the people
[Line 708] as to the change.  Government could not do it themselves.  Even if
[Line 709] their amendment were good it would raise a hornets' nest about their
[Line 710] ears.
[Line 711]  Thus here again is an _impasse_, and a dangerous one, typical of many.
[Line 712]  By our system of Civil Law and Civil Courts, of precedent and case law we have petrified the bonds in which India lay when we arrived and made them far more rigid than before.  While by our introduction of new
[Line 713] ideas and of greater material progress we have rendered the old laws more and more obsolete, we have at the same time stopped all evolution
[Line 714] of these laws, and killed any capacity they had for accommodating
[Line 715] themselves to change.  Some lawyers even, enthusiastic as they are
[Line 716] about their own profession, have seen this danger.  Here is what Sir
[Line 717] Henry Sumner Maine, who was Legal Member to the Government of India, says:
[Line 718]  "What that law and usage"--Indian law and usage--"was, the Sudder Court used to ascertain with what some would call most conscientious accuracy and others the most technical narrowness.  Under the hand of the Judges of the Sudder Courts the native rules hardened and contracted a rigidity which they never had in real native practice.  Among the older records of their proceedings may be found injunctions couched in the technical language of English Chancery proceedings which forbid the priests of a particular temple to injure a rival fane by painting the
[Line 719] face of their idol red instead of yellow, and decrees allowing the
[Line 720] complaint of other priests that they were injured in property and
[Line 721] repute because their neighbours rang a bell at a particular moment of
[Line 722] their services.  There is in truth but little doubt that until
[Line 723] education began to cause the natives of India to absorb Western ideas for themselves the influence of the English rather retarded than hastened the mental development of the race."
[Line 724] And it does so more and more, because however much they may absorb
[Line 725] Western ideas theoretically, they cannot express them practically owing
[Line 726] to our petrifaction of their law and custom.
[Line 727]  Again.  "The methods of interpretation which the Sudder Courts borrowed
[Line 728] from the Supreme Courts imported from Westminster Hall put a stop to
[Line 729] any natural growth and improvement of Hindu law."  That is to say we introduced new ideas, but sat on the safety-valve lest they should produce any effect.  Sir Henry Sumner Maine's book is
[Line 730] full of similar expressions, but I need quote no more.  Those who wish to read how a lawyer himself has admitted this failure of law will no doubt read the book for themselves. 
[Line 731] And now let us go on to the other functions of the Civil Courts--money decrees and so forth. 
[Line 732] I do not think that they are any more in touch with the public than the Criminal Courts.
[Line 733]  To begin with, they suffer from the same defect that a trial before a
[Line 734] Civil Court is not an inquiry into truth, but a duel between parties.
[Line 735] Indeed this is even more manifest than in the Criminal Courts, for
[Line 736] there the magistrate does to the best of his small ability go outside
[Line 737] the record and try to ascertain facts for himself; in the Civil Courts the judge never does so.  He is simply and purely an umpire.  Has the plaintiff proved his case?  If so, give him a decree; if not, then not. Therefore perjury, and even forgery, are more common here than in the Criminal Courts. 
[Line 738] Now let us go back to the way suits originate, and see what the cause is.  There are, of course, a few cases where the issue is clear from the first.  A dies.  B and C both claim his inheritance.  Here from the beginning is a clear issue which can be brought into Court and fought out.  It must come into Court, because in no other way could it be settled.  But there are few such suits.  In the great majority of cases the original issue is quite a small one, but when it comes into Court
[Line 739] it is, by one side or the other, or both, swollen out of all recognition.  Take the following as an example.  It is from a case I
[Line 740] heard once.
[Line 741] A and B were both natives of India--Hindus--and had been partners.  I
[Line 742] cannot remember their business beyond that they bought articles in
[Line 743] Upper India and imported them into Upper Burma, where they sold them. It was a small business.  One partner would go to India, buy stock, and
[Line 744] return with it to Burma.  They would both trade in it, and when it was nearly done one of them would go away to India again.  This had gone on
[Line 745] for some years.  They agreed together excellently and made a decent
[Line 746] profit.  They kept all their accounts in their heads, aided by an occasional scrap of memoranda, and made a settlement from time to time.
[Line 747]  Then they would begin afresh.  At last came a disagreement.
[Line 748]  When A returned to Burma with a new stock, B objected to the price paid for one item, alleging that A had been "done," and had paid too much.
[Line 749]  A indignantly repelled this accusation.  B stood to his guns.  The item was only about five hundred rupees, and the difference was not more
[Line 750] than twenty or thirty rupees, but neither would give way. 
[Line 751] The quarrel grew.  B said he would not share in the item; A said he
[Line 752] must, as it was a partnership transaction.  B said he didn't care.  A
[Line 753] said he would sue him in Court.  B said, "Very well, sue me."  So each went off to get a pleader.
[Line 754]  In due time the case came into Court, but what a case!  Each side had considered that if he had got to fight he had better get all the
[Line 755] weapons he could, so he raked up everything he could think of.  It was
[Line 756] a duel, you see, wherein each side fought not to settle the little
[Line 757] point at issue, but for victory--any kind of victory he could get. Each side stirred up every sleeping dog of war he could find, resuscitated and galvanised dead dogs, made up imitation dogs, and came to battle.  The issues finally framed covered several years' transactions, and the
[Line 758] evidence included forged documents and quantities of perjury.  Both sides were ruined.  That is what comes of making a trial a duel.  Each side fights for
[Line 759] victory, to save his _amour propre_, and to wound the enemy wherever he
[Line 760] can.  The original cause of difference is quite lost.  Now that case is typical of many.  It is illustrative of human nature
[Line 761] all the world over.  If you awake the fighting instinct you cannot confine the parties to the original seat of war; they will urge the
[Line 762] attack wherever they are likely to win.  They cannot go to the judge in the beginning as to a friend of both parties who will inquire into the
[Line 763] cause of difference himself and find a reasonable settlement, because
[Line 764] judges are not intended to do that.  Therefore parties do not go to Court at all until they have determined to fight it out.  The case does not come to Court till matters are hopeless.
[Line 765] You may say they should or could have gone to an arbitrator.  Do people
[Line 766] anywhere in the world trust an unofficial arbitrator?  There is a
[Line 767] provision in Upper Burma allowing reference to arbitration, but it is a dead letter.
[Line 768]  The original dispute in this case was about twenty or thirty rupees, the alleged excess paid for the goods.  The suit filed was for several thousand rupees in transactions spread over years: there was an equally
[Line 769] heavy counterclaim.
[Line 770] The total value of the suits filed in Burma in 1910 was about
[Line 771] £1,380,000.  I wonder what the value was of the matters first in dispute before the cases came to Court.  A fifth, I dare say, would cover them.  I notice much the same thing in England.  Human nature does not differ East or West.  Now consider the enormous expense of all this.  The value of the
[Line 772] subject-matter of suits filed in Burma in 1910 was, as I have said, £1,380,000.  The value of the matters really in dispute before they
[Line 773] came to Court was infinitely less, but Court fees and lawyers' fees had to be paid on the full amount.  Witnesses in thousands were called to prove matters that should never have come into Court at all.  And with what result? 
[Line 774] There were 70,203 suits filed and decrees given, but in 53,594 of these satisfaction could not be obtained, and so the decree-holders had to
[Line 775] come to Court for warrants for execution.  That is to say that in over five suits out of seven the losing party could not or would not pay.
[Line 776] (It does not follow that in the other two out of the seven he did pay.
[Line 777] The decree-holder in a percentage of cases no doubt did not think it worth while to go any further.)  But in 53,594 cases he came to Court for execution.  What did he get? In half these cases he got absolutely nothing; the execution was
[Line 778] "wholly infructuous."  In the other cases satisfaction was obtained in
[Line 779] full or in part.
[Line 780] Thus out of £1,380,000 claimed how much was obtained?  The Report does
[Line 781] not give figures, but the reader can judge for himself it wasn't much. And to get even this little, what was the cost to the litigants, that
[Line 782] is the public?  No one knows.  But there are a great many lawyers of
[Line 783] kinds in Burma, and a good deal of money goes into their hands.
[Line 784]  I do not think it would be an over-estimate to say that for every pound
[Line 785] originally in dispute two pounds were spent in costs and only ten
[Line 786] shillings recovered, and to get this, think of the trouble, the worry, the indignity, and the self-contempt involved.  Besides, think of the waste of time--to say nothing of truth.  In the Report from which I take these figures the Judges of the High Court point out that the Courts are yearly becoming less and less used by the public.  They can't think how this can be; but they suppose it is due to years of prosperity.  That it should be due to anything wrong
[Line 787] about the Courts never occurs to them.  Yet perhaps the reader will see
[Line 788] reason to doubt if the system of Civil Justice is perfect.
[Line 789]  There is an Indian proverb that it is wise to go to law once, foolish to go twice.  I asked an Indian about this. 
[Line 790] "Why is it wise to go once?" I asked.  "Because," he answered, "you learn a great deal, quite a great deal,
[Line 791] which you never forget.  You learn, anyhow, not to go twice."  "But," I objected, "suppose on a subsequent occasion money were due to you which you couldn't get, would you sit down under the loss?"
[Line 792] He looked at me and laughed.  "Well," he said, "if it were a small debt
[Line 793] I should let it go.  If I thought the man could not pay I would let it go, big or little; but if I thought he could pay and wouldn't, I wouldn't sue him; no, but I wouldn't put up with him either."
[Line 794]  "What then would you do?"
[Line 795]  "Well," he answered reflectively, "I think I should rob him." 
[Line 796] "But that might bring you into a Criminal Court," I remonstrated.
[Line 797] "So it might," he replied; "but the Criminal Courts can't be worse than
[Line 798] the Civil; and, anyhow, it would be a change." 
[Line 799] As to the Insolvent side of the Civil Courts, perhaps if I say that it
[Line 800] is no nearer the people than any other side, enough will have been said, and later on I shall have a story to tell of some of my
[Line 801] experiences, but this is not the place.
[Line 802]  What is gained by imprisoning a man for debt?  Nothing that I ever
[Line 803] heard of.  It is not required to deter him from being ruined again; he
[Line 804] probably won't get the chance, and if he did the fact of having been sold up once is quite sufficient deterrent from wanting to be sold up again.
[Line 805]  Will it deter others?  People don't get ruined for the fun of the
[Line 806] thing.  It is a dreadful thing to be sold up; in itself that is quite
[Line 807] enough.  Then what good does imprisoning the poor devil do?  It does
[Line 808] none.  It does harm, and nothing but harm.  It hurts the debtor and
[Line 809] prevents his recovering himself; it panders to the desire of society
[Line 810] and of creditors for revenge.  There is an idea abroad that when
[Line 811] anything untoward happens somebody should be punished, and then society will have vindicated itself.  But the duty of society is to prevent
[Line 812] crime, not punish it, and it cannot whitewash itself in this way.  It merely condemns itself more even than it condemns him it punishes.  Moreover, the ability of creditors to imprison debtors is misused in a
[Line 813] way that is almost criminal.  The creditor will imprison the debtor
[Line 814] with the hope that the debtor's relatives and friends will subscribe to
[Line 815] save him and them from this disgrace.  That is to say, the law allows a creditor to put improper pressure on totally innocent people in order to get his claims satisfied.  Think of the iniquity of a law like that! 
[Line 816] And what are these claims?  Are they just claims?  They are legal claims, but are they just?
[Line 817] For the most part they are claims of money-lenders.  The Courts act as collecting agencies to the most oppressive system of money-lending that
[Line 818] can be imagined.  Two and a half per-cent per month is not unusual.  Government has shown its recognition of this danger by creating
[Line 819] Co-operative Credit Banks, which are a great boon.  But it has not thought of revising its Civil Court procedure.  As in most other matters, it recognises something wrong, but attributes it to the
[Line 820] people, not to the Courts and the law; therefore it does nothing. 
[Line 821] But at all events imprisonment for debt should be abolished.  There were eight hundred unfortunate debtors imprisoned in Burma in 1910.  Do you wonder that the people dread and hate the Courts?  Civil law embraces a great variety of suits besides suits for money,
[Line 822] and includes a great number of special laws.  The harm that has been
[Line 823] done by fossilising Hindu, Mohammedan, and Buddhist law and custom has
[Line 824] been already mentioned; to enter further into these matters is
[Line 825] unnecessary.  Once it is clearly recognised that the law and the Courts require amendment, not in details but in fundamental principles, there will be many better critics than I am.  For although I have been
[Line 826] obliged to learn some law in order to do my work, I was never an apt
[Line 827] student of it.  Humanity and justice are the only studies I really care
[Line 828] for.  Law is mainly a denial of both.  Therefore if the Government of India and the local officials will but give up thinking that where law
[Line 829] and human nature disagree it is so much the worse for human nature, they will soon find out where the present laws are wrong.  But before I
[Line 830] close this chapter there is one further point I wish to mention, and that is the trial of Burmese divorce suits by our Courts.  Now that is
[Line 831] wrong, absolutely wrong, and indefensible in every way.  The Courts are not concerned with divorce.  It is by Burmese custom and common sense a
[Line 832] purely village matter.  Divorces can be given by the elders, and they alone should be allowed to pronounce them.  For they are sensible men,
[Line 833] and in such cases they act not as judges, but as neighbours.  They will
[Line 834] grant no divorce till they have exhausted all means of conciliation. They know the parties as no judge can know them; they know who is to
[Line 835] blame, how he or she is to blame, how the difference can be adjusted.
[Line 836] It is to their interest to smooth things down and prevent their getting
[Line 837] worse.  Theoretically the breakers of marriages, they are in fact the
[Line 838] preservers of marriage.  It is by their tact and common sense that couples are kept together, and that only when matters become impossible
[Line 839] divorces are granted. 
[Line 840] But a judge is different.  He knows nothing, cares nothing, can do nothing but listen to the complaint and grant the divorce.  It must legally be granted at the request of either party, remember.  To allow
[Line 841] a judge to try divorce cases is a violation of Burmese law and custom,
[Line 842] and is another and deep injury to the village community.  How and why it was ever allowed I don't know.  I suppose no one ever thought about
[Line 843] it.  Divorces in England are granted by Courts according to English
[Line 844] law, therefore in Burma divorces can be granted according to Burmese
[Line 845] law.  I suppose that was the argument--if ever there was any argument at all.
[Line 846]  In any case it is wrong.  Divorces are properly granted by the elders
[Line 847] acting on behalf of the community, and by no one else.  Therefore the interference of the Courts should be immediately stopped.
[Line 848]  But apart from this, the questions of marriage and inheritance are very
[Line 849] difficult.  No alien Government can solve them.  They must await a real Council that can deal with such matters with knowledge and
[Line 850] responsibility.    
[Line 851] CHAPTER VIII  THE VILLAGE
[Line 852] But of all the errors of Indian government, none is so serious as their destruction of the Village organism throughout India; none has had such
[Line 853] an effect in the past; none is likely to have such bad consequences in
[Line 854] the future. 
[Line 855] It is the Village policy of government that has created for it the most
[Line 856] difficulties, and which is at the bottom of the most serious unrest.
[Line 857] For it touches not merely a few as criminal law, but practically all
[Line 858] the population; it affects not only a part of the life of India, but it has injured it in its most vital point.  In the whole history of administration there is nothing I think so demonstrative of the ignorance of government as the Village policy.
[Line 859]  The foundation on which not only all government but all civilisation rests throughout the world is the village.  As this is contrary to the
[Line 860] usual idea that civilisation rests on the family it will be convenient to shortly show how this is so.  The village is the microcosm of the State, because it includes within it divers trades and occupations and races and religions and castes in one community.  A family does not do
[Line 861] so.  A family is by its nature of one blood, it is almost always of one
[Line 862] occupation.  There are families of cultivators, merchants, priests, lawyers, smiths, and so on.  It is of one religion, of one caste, of one habit of thought.  A family is narrow and a village is broad. Families divide; villages combine.  Societies organised on the family,
[Line 863] or clan, or tribe principle have always failed--by the very nature of
[Line 864] things they must so fail.  The Jews are a race, or tribe, and not a nation.  They have no civilisation of their own, but adopt that in
[Line 865] which they live.  The Highland clans had to be broken before the Highlands could be civilised.  The caste system in India ruined its old
[Line 866] civilisation, and is the bar to any new civilisation.  The Turkish
[Line 867] Empire is dead because it was based on a religious caste divided from all others by a mutilation, and its people could never amalgamate with
[Line 868] others.  There is a continual flow of peoples to and fro upon the
[Line 869] earth, and village communities absorb the new-comers and thereby
[Line 870] acquire new blood, and, what is far more important, new ideas, to add to the old and leaven them.  Families, classes and tribes cannot do
[Line 871] this.  They become stereotyped, and dissolve or die.  Thus the basis of all civilisation has been the village, or in later times the town.  The decay and death of all civilisations have been preceded by the death of the local unit.  Thus imperial Rome was itself doomed to death when it destroyed local life; and a new civilisation could not be built up till the local communities had attained a fresh life.  Florence, Genoa,
[Line 872] Milan, Pisa, Venice, and many others made the civilisation of the Renaissance.  So in England, a free Parliament was made up of representatives from free cities and counties.  These have been destroyed, and the present constituencies are merely so many voters.
[Line 873] Policies are no longer decided in Parliament, but in secret party conclave.  Members are the nominees of that conclave, not of free local organisms, and Parliament has become a machine to register its decrees. So are free institutions passing away. 
[Line 874] There is no lesson of history more true--more certain--than this, that the village or town is the unit of all free life and civilisation.  It
[Line 875] contains all classes, different races, religions, castes and forms of thought, and is therefore a real unit.
[Line 876]  Now these units have existed all over the world, and when civilisations
[Line 877] and governments have disappeared they have been built up anew from the villages.  In India the village system was the one organism that survived the long years of anarchy and invasion, and it was in full vigour when we conquered India.  Those who care to read up the subject can see it in Sir Henry Sumner Maine's _Indian Village Communities_.  In Upper Burma, on its annexation in 1885, the village community was
[Line 878] strong and healthy; it alone survived the fall of King Thibaw's
[Line 879] Government.  Then we deliberately destroyed it, as we had destroyed it
[Line 880] before all through India.
[Line 881] Now this is an instructive and interesting fact, for it was destroyed
[Line 882] in ignorance, not by _malice prepense_.
[Line 883] Throughout India--and especially in Burma--you will find Government reiterating its conviction of the importance of preserving the village
[Line 884] organism, repeating the conviction of its absolute necessity, and at
[Line 885] the same time killing it.  This is but an instance of much of the
[Line 886] action of Government.  It means well; it does actually see the end to be attained--it has no idea how to attain that end; but, instead, it renders it impossible. 
[Line 887] If I explain what happened in Burma, the history, _mutatis mutandis_,
[Line 888] of what has occurred throughout India will be clear. 
[Line 889] In the first place, a "village" does not mean only one collection of
[Line 890] houses; it is a territorial unit of from one to a hundred square miles. Originally, of course, there was in each unit one hamlet; but, as
[Line 891] population grew, daughter hamlets were thrown off.  They still,
[Line 892] however, remained under the jurisdiction of the mother hamlet, and they
[Line 893] all together formed one village.  In each village there were a Headman
[Line 894] and a Council of Elders.  The headman was appointed or rather approved
[Line 895] by the Burmese Government for life or good behaviour; the council was
[Line 896] not recognised by law.  Notwithstanding this, the council was the real
[Line 897] power.  It was not formally elected, it had no legal standing, but it
[Line 898] was the real power.  The headman was only its representative and not its master; he was but _primus inter pares_.
[Line 899] This headman and council ruled all village matters.  They settled the house sites, the rights of way, the marriage of boys and girls, divorces, public manners; they put up such public works as were done,
[Line 900] they divided the tax amongst the inhabitants according to their means,
[Line 901] and were collectively responsible for the whole.  There was hardly any
[Line 902] appeal from their decision, but the power not being localised in an individual but in a council of all the elders, things went well.  The
[Line 903] village was a real living organism, within which people learned to act together, to bear and forbear; there were a local patriotism and a local pride.  Within it lay the germ of unlimited progress.
[Line 904]  The English Government on taking over Upper Burma recognised the
[Line 905] extreme value of this organisation.  In Lower Burma much of our
[Line 906] difficulty arose from the fact that the organisation was wanting and
[Line 907] that between Government and the individual there was no one.  So one of the first efforts of Government in Upper Burma was to endeavour to
[Line 908] preserve and strengthen this local self-government.  Unfortunately
[Line 909] every effort it made resulted in destroying it rather than
[Line 910] consolidating it.  A wrong view was taken from the beginning. 
[Line 911] The council was ignored.  How this happened I do not know, I can only
[Line 912] suppose that it arose from ignorance.  The only man recognised by the Burmese Government we replaced was the headman.  They dealt directly
[Line 913] with him and not with the council.  They did not appoint the council or
[Line 914] regulate it in any way.  In law no council existed.  Therefore, when we
[Line 915] took over, the law was mistaken for the fact--a common mistake, due to
[Line 916] seeking for knowledge in papers, and not in life--and the council was
[Line 917] ignored.  The following seems to have been the argument: Government appointed the headman, therefore he was an official.  Government did
[Line 918] not appoint or recognise any council, therefore there was no council.
[Line 919] Anyhow, that was the decision arrived at and enforced.
[Line 920] There is on record a circular of the Local Government in which the headman of a village is described as a Government official; to be to his village what the District Officer is to his district.  That is disastrous.  A headman is not an official of the Government.  His whole value and meaning is that he is a representative of the people before Government.  He expresses the collective views of the village and receives the orders of Government for them as a whole.  He is _their_ head, not a finger of Government.  He corresponded almost exactly to
[Line 921] the mayor of an English town, who would be insulted if you called him a
[Line 922] Government official.  Yet this mistaken view was taken of the village headman, and this error has vitiated all dealings of Government with
[Line 923] the village organisation and its headman.  He is appointed by
[Line 924] Government instead of being appointed by the people and approved by Government.  He is responsible to Government, not to his village--as he ought to be--for the use or abuse of his powers.  He is punished by
[Line 925] Government for laxity.  By the Village Regulation he can be fined by the District Officer.  There has grown up among Europeans in the East a custom of imposing
[Line 926] fines.  They fine their servants for breakages and innumerable other
[Line 927] small matters, and then complain how scarce good servants are.  The
[Line 928] clerks in Government offices used to be subject to continual fines
[Line 929] until Lord Curzon stopped it.  Now headmen of villages can be fined by the District Officer; and they are fined; the proviso is no dead
[Line 930] letter.  It is a mark of the "energetic" officer to use it.  Can there
[Line 931] be anything more destructive?  Imagine the headman, the mayor of a
[Line 932] community of three or four thousand people, fined five shillings for the delay of a return, or set, like a schoolboy, to learn a code--with
[Line 933] the clerks.  I have seen this done often.  What respect for Government,
[Line 934] what from his own people, what self-respect, can he retain after such treatment?  Again, by ignoring the council and making the headman an official, Government set up a number of petty tyrants in the villages, free from all control but its own; consequently it has been forced to allow great latitude of appeal.  This still further destroys his authority.  He is under old custom, legalised by the Village Regulation, empowered to punish his villagers who disobey him in certain matters.  The punishments are, of course, trivial.  When approved by the council, as in old days, they were final; but now they can be appealed against--and
[Line 935] are.  A headman who endeavours to enforce his authority runs the risk of being complained against and forced to attend Headquarters, to waste
[Line 936] days of valuable time and considerable sums of money to defend himself
[Line 937] for having fined a villager a shilling for not mending his fence.  One
[Line 938] or two experiences of this sort and the headman lets things slide in future.  Thus interference with the village is constant and disastrous.  Headmen are bullied, fined, set to learn lessons like children, all in the name
[Line 939] of efficiency.  And Government wonders why the village system decays.
[Line 940] A continual complaint of Government is that headmen are no longer the
[Line 941] men they used to be, that they have lost authority.  The best men will not take the appointment--and who can wonder?  Here is a story in
[Line 942] illustration:
[Line 943] There was a small village in my district, on a main road, and the
[Line 944] headman died.  It was necessary to appoint a new one.  But no one would take the appointment.  The elders were asked to nominate a man, but no one would take the nomination.  I sent the Township Officer to try to
[Line 945] arrange; he failed. 
[Line 946] Now a village cannot get along without a headman.  Government is at an end; no taxes can be collected, for instance; therefore it was necessary a headman be appointed at once.  I went to the village myself
[Line 947] and called the elders and gave them an order that they must nominate
[Line 948] someone.  So next morning, after stormy meetings in the village, a man
[Line 949] was brought to me and introduced as the headman-elect.  He was dirty, ill-clad, and not at all the sort of man I should have cared to
[Line 950] appoint, nor one whom it would be supposed the villagers would care to
[Line 951] accept.  Yet he was the only nominee.
[Line 952]  "What is your occupation?" I asked.  He said he had none. 
[Line 953] "What tax did you pay last year?"  I asked him this in order to discover his standing, for men are rated according to their means. 
[Line 954] He told me that he had paid five shillings--less than a third of the
[Line 955] average.
[Line 956]  "You are willing to be headman?" I asked.
[Line 957]  "No," he said frankly.  "But no one would take the place, and the elders told me I must.  They said they would prosecute me under the 'bad livelihood' section if I didn't.  I could take my choice between
[Line 958] being headman or a term in prison."
[Line 959]  This was, of course, an extreme case, but it illustrates the position.
[Line 960] The headman is degraded and all administration suffers. 
[Line 961] It is the same in municipalities.  The work is done by the District
[Line 962] Officer because it is easier for him to do it than to instruct and allow others to do it.
[Line 963] The people one and all hate this.  The headman hates it, because though
[Line 964] he is given much greater power nominally than he used to have he dare not use this power.  He is isolated from his villagers, and so often becomes an object of dislike to them.  Through him orders are enforced which are not liked by the people, and he has to bear all the brunt. His dignity is gone.  Sometimes he is murdered.  The elders hate it.  They have been ignored.  They are placed under a headman who may or may not attend to what they say.  They have lost all interest--because all power--in their village affairs.  They have no
[Line 965] responsibility.
[Line 966]  The villagers hate it.  A council of their own elders they could respect and submit to; a one-man rule they detest.  Their appeal to the council on the spot (who know) has been lost; and in place of it they
[Line 967] have an appeal to a distant officer who, with the best will in the
[Line 968] world, cannot know.  An appeal costs money, and even to win may be to
[Line 969] lose.  They all want to manage their affairs; they can do it far better than we can, and there is nothing they so much appreciate as being allowed to do so.  Here is how I learnt this:  Some eighteen years ago I was leaving a station where I had been for a year as subordinate officer, and had to cross the river by launch to the steamer station on the other shore.  I went down to the bank to get the launch, but it was late.  I saw it three miles away, and so sat
[Line 970] down under a tree to wait.  Presently two or three elderly Burmans came and sat down near me.  Then came others, till maybe twenty elderly men were there.  I recognised two or three vaguely, but none clearly.  I wondered at their being
[Line 971] there, and asked: 
[Line 972] "Are you crossing over too?"
[Line 973] They shook their heads. 
[Line 974] "What are you here for, then?"
[Line 975]  They looked embarrassed, and at last one spoke.  "We came to say
[Line 976] 'Good-bye' to you."  I stared.  "But I do not know you, except that I suppose you are elders
[Line 977] of the town."
[Line 978] "We are," they said, "and you do not know us because you have not ever worried us in any way.  When we had business together you did it quickly and decisively; otherwise you left us alone.  You did not treat
[Line 979] us as children.  Therefore we are sorry you are going."
[Line 980] I laughed.  I could not help it.  To come and express regret at a man's
[Line 981] leaving on the ground that they knew next to nothing of him and did not
[Line 982] want to know more seemed unusual. 
[Line 983] But it was true.  And often, after, did I think over that "send-off" and take the lesson to heart.
[Line 984]  Now what is true in Burma is true over all India.  The local circumstances of course vary.  A lumbadar in the North-West, for instance, does not quite correspond to a headman in Burma.  The actual form in which the village was organised differs from place to place according to local needs.  Even in Burma it differed a good deal.  But the differences were only of form.  In all India there were
[Line 985] self-contained village communities within which, to a certain extent,
[Line 986] caste, religion, and race were subordinated to local communal feeling.  And everywhere Government has killed it by turning the village
[Line 987] officials into Government officials, responsible to Government and not
[Line 988] to the village.
[Line 989] Thus there is now absolutely no organism a man can belong to.  There
[Line 990] are three hundred and fifty million individuals in India, and that is all.  They are divided laterally into strata by caste and religion, and there is no influence to draw them together.  All organised life is
[Line 991] dead.  Government by means of its official--the headman--interferes
[Line 992] with almost every detail of life, regulating his conduct by rules drawn
[Line 993] up in Secretariats by men who never knew what a village was, and the
[Line 994] appeal is to another alien officer.  Further, all morality and all conduct are the outcome of corporate
[Line 995] life, that is to say, of the village or of a larger unit.  Morality is, in fact, where it is useful and true, the knowledge of how to get along with your fellow men and women, what conduct offends them and leads to
[Line 996] the injury of society, what pleases them and tends to harmony and mutual happiness.  It is not fixed, but adapts itself to changing
[Line 997] circumstances of the society, and it is enforced by the opinion of that
[Line 998] society. 
[Line 999] But injure the society and both manners and morals are shaken.  It is a common complaint of India to-day that the bonds of morality have greatly slackened and that manners have almost disappeared.  This is attributed to the waning influence of religions.  But, generally
[Line 1000] speaking, religions have not waned in India--on the contrary, their influences have increased.  The people have become more and more in the
[Line 1001] power of religious systems.  Therefore the cause given is absurd and untrue.  It does not exist.  Further, neither morality nor manners are
[Line 1002] the outcome of religion.  On the contrary.  Religions claim them to be
[Line 1003] so, but the claim is false.  Manners and morals may be said to be the
[Line 1004] gravity which binds individuals into a community.  They make the community and are themselves the outcome of the community.  Destroy the community and you have destroyed the source from which manners and morals arise.  That has been done all through India.  In another book I have pointed
[Line 1005] out how disastrously this has acted in Burma and how much the people
[Line 1006] feel it.  I do not want to repeat myself.  But if those officials who deplore the frequent cases of young girls running away with boys, of
[Line 1007] seduction, of adultery and other offences, of immature marriages, and
[Line 1008] other mistakes, would but realise that all these arise from the injury we have caused to society, there might be a change.  All the human
[Line 1009] virtues, with no exception, either arise from or are increased by the aggregation of men into communities, and it is very difficult to keep them alive where no organic communities exist.  Consider the words humanity, civilisation, patriotism, urbanity--their derivations and
[Line 1010] their meanings--and you will see this. 
[Line 1011] I do not think I need say more.  I have tried to set out the facts as clearly and dispassionately as I can.  I have omitted much that I might
[Line 1012] have said.  I have tried here, as throughout, to understate difficulties rather than exaggerate them, because exaggeration defeats its own ends.  But I think if the reader will try to realise to himself the state of affairs where no village has a say even in its simplest
[Line 1013] affairs, and where everything is under the eye of a Government
[Line 1014] official, where all initiative is forbidden and where the best men stand aloof from all interest in village affairs, he will have some
[Line 1015] idea that unrest is not unreasonable.  The village organism was the one vital institution left to India; it
[Line 1016] was the one germ of corporate life that could have been encouraged into a larger growth.  It has been killed.  It will have to be resuscitated before India can cease to be _India Irredenta_.   
[Line 1017] CHAPTER IX 
[Line 1018] OPIUM AND EXCISE
[Line 1019]  I will begin what I have to say about this by telling a little story
[Line 1020] about what happened to me when I was a Subordinate Magistrate--some
[Line 1021] sixteen years ago now.  A Burman was brought up before me charged with possessing opium.  A
[Line 1022] Sergeant of Police had met him at a rest-house in the jungle the day before, and had entered into conversation.  The man was sickly and told
[Line 1023] the Sergeant that he was on his way down from the Shan States, where he
[Line 1024] had gone to trade.  But he had caught the prevalent fever, had then
[Line 1025] lain ill and lost his money.  So he was going home again to his village about fifty miles away, where he hoped to recover his health. Meanwhile he took a little opium for the fever, for in the Shan States opium is not contraband.  "Oh, you have opium?" asked the Sergeant.
[Line 1026] "I brought some down with me," the man said, producing it.  Then the Sergeant, as in duty bound, arrested him and brought him into Court.
[Line 1027] The case was quite clear.  The man admitted the opium, urged that he
[Line 1028] was ill, also that he did not know--neither of which is a defence in
[Line 1029] law--and I passed the smallest sentence that I thought the High Court would allow to pass without a reprimand.  I fined him ten rupees or in default ten days' imprisonment.  Then I went on to other cases and forgot about it.  At four o'clock I left the bench and went to my private room to sign papers before leaving Court.  There was a pile of them.  I signed, the peon pulled away; I signed again, he pulled; and so on till I looked up.  There in the doorway stood the Sergeant.  He seemed embarrassed.  He smiled an awkward smile, saluted, and then stood doubtfully on one foot and the other.
[Line 1030]  "Well?" I asked, surprised.  "What is the matter?"
[Line 1031] "Nothing," he replied.
[Line 1032] "Then you needn't stay," I said suggestively, and went on signing.  He didn't go.  He smiled again and swallowed.  I signed a dozen sheets or more and then looked up, and there he was, still smiling.
[Line 1033] "Well," I asked, "what is the matter?  Out with it."
[Line 1034] "We are all poor men," he said.
[Line 1035]  "Who are?" I asked carelessly. 
[Line 1036] "All we police," he said.  "I gave a whole rupee, but the others could give but a penny or twopence each because they are only constables.  We
[Line 1037] could not afford more.  We are poor men, your Honour."
[Line 1038] I stopped my signing.  "Sergeant," I said, "come here.  I don't know
[Line 1039] what you're talking about.  What is the matter?"
[Line 1040]  "There is a little girl," he answered, coming up to the table.  "That's
[Line 1041] the difficulty."  I held my head between my hands.  I had no idea of what he could be
[Line 1042] talking about.  The syncopated method of beginning a conversation which
[Line 1043] Burmese often use made my head ache.  I stared, he stared.  At last I
[Line 1044] said:
[Line 1045]  "Sergeant, I'm going home," and rose.  Then it all came out.  It was the opium smuggler.  He could not pay the fine, for he was penniless.  He had no friends this side of fifty miles away, and he had with him a little daughter aged ten years or so.  This was, of course,
[Line 1046] the first that I had heard of her, but it seems that she was just outside when her father was being tried, and when she heard he had to
[Line 1047] go to gaol she was in despair.  They wept together. 
[Line 1048] Therefore the Sergeant whose zeal had caused the trouble repented of his work and took up a collection.  In the police-office and among my clerks he got five rupees.  That was but half, and they did not know
[Line 1049] where to get the rest.  Then someone had a brilliant idea.  "Go," he
[Line 1050] said to the Sergeant, "ask the magistrate."  "Therefore," said the
[Line 1051] Sergeant, "I came in to your Honour."
[Line 1052] "For what?"
[Line 1053]  "The other five rupees."
[Line 1054]  I laughed.  How could I help it?  The audacity of the demand, that I, the magistrate, should pay half the fine that I had myself inflicted!
[Line 1055]  "Sergeant," I said severely, "what have you and I to do with offenders
[Line 1056] who break the law?  Are we to pay for them?  What is the good of _your_ arresting them and my fining them if we afterwards pay their fines for them?  We make a mockery of the law and ruin ourselves." 
[Line 1057] He did not answer.
[Line 1058] "You see the point?" I asked.  He did.
[Line 1059]  "Then I am going home."  The Sergeant saluted.  "I didn't suppose your Honour has the money in
[Line 1060] Court.  Shall I come for it or will your Honour send it over?" he replied.
[Line 1061]  "Send what?"
[Line 1062]  "The five rupees."  I sent it over. 
[Line 1063] This story, besides illustrating the kindheartedness of the people and
[Line 1064] their quickness to see the injustice of a law and try to remedy it, shows the difficulty Government have in this matter of opium.
[Line 1065]  Now I do not intend to go into this very controversial subject.  I have
[Line 1066] read the evidence and the Report of the Opium Commission some years
[Line 1067] ago, and I have my own opinion about both.  That I will keep to myself.
[Line 1068] All I have to say here is that opium in reasonable doses is a most valuable drug--the most valuable we have.  It is in fever-haunted districts the best friend of the people.  Some of the best fighting men of the Empire take it and demand it.  In its time and place it is no more harmful than liquor, and I have no belief in putting the world into an iron case of everlasting "Don'ts."  People should be made
[Line 1069] temperate by training and judicious restriction of opportunity, and not made the slaves of laws.  I don't believe in slavery of any kind.  But opium can be and is abused, and there is no doubt that amongst the Burmese generally there is a desire that its use be totally prohibited. A general opinion like that should be respected whether it is right or
[Line 1070] wrong. 
[Line 1071] There comes the difficulty.  Take Burma as a whole and consider it.
[Line 1072] The vast majority of the inhabitants are Burmese, but in places in
[Line 1073] Lower Burma there are large colonies of Hindus and Mohammedans.  There are, moreover, many Chinese traders and carpenters spread about all
[Line 1074] over.  They are accustomed to use opium, were so accustomed before they
[Line 1075] came there, would not have come if they could not have got their stimulant.  Then, again, Burma is bounded on the east by the independent Shan States, where there is a great deal of fever, where opium grows, and the people use it.  Beyond these States is China, where opium is grown largely.  Moreover, there are in Lower Burma one or two districts where
[Line 1076] fever is very deadly and opium is used by the Burmans with the consent of public opinion. 
[Line 1077] Now sum up all these factors, and see how complicated the problem is.
[Line 1078] The Burmans generally want opium prohibited.  "Very well," says
[Line 1079] Government; "we will prohibit it for Burmans; but what about the rest
[Line 1080] of the population?  They want it; their public opinion does not forbid
[Line 1081] it.  They are immigrants, and would not have come if they had been
[Line 1082] unable to get it.  Therefore there must be opium shops for them.  But
[Line 1083] Burmans shall not be allowed to buy."  So far so good in appearance.  The Burman may not buy from the shop,
[Line 1084] and doesn't.  He buys from a friendly Chinaman, who for a little commission buys the opium at the shop and hands it over outside.
[Line 1085]  But this trick was discovered, and Government did its best.  It allowanced all Chinamen.  They could buy so much and no more, just
[Line 1086] enough for their own use.  If they sold to Burmans they had to go without themselves.
[Line 1087]  That was excellent, only there were two ways round.  One was for
[Line 1088] Chinamen who did not use opium--not all do--to act as honest broker;
[Line 1089] the other was smuggling from the Shan States.  The quantity of opium smuggled down from the Shan States cannot be estimated, nor can it be stopped.  How can you guard five hundred miles of frontier all mountain
[Line 1090] and forest, intersected by forest paths?  Opium is light, compact,
[Line 1091] easily concealed.  Government does its best, but it cannot do the impossible. 
[Line 1092] Therefore the Acts are widely evaded, which is always a bad thing; but there is a worse effect than this--there is discrimination by nationality.
[Line 1093]  I do not think there can be anything worse than an Act that says such
[Line 1094] and such an act is right and proper for people of one nationality but
[Line 1095] wrong and penal for people of another.  A Chinaman may walk about and
[Line 1096] do openly what if a Burman does he goes to gaol for.  What difference is there between the natures of the two people to make such a
[Line 1097] difference?  There is none.  Therefore the effect of this law, although it be according to the general desire, is to make the Burman feel that he is a child not to be trusted.  This is a bad feeling.  If opium were totally prohibited in Upper Burma for everybody except Indian troops or officials sent there by Government, and therefore not free to stay away, this feeling would not arise.  If local option is to have effect it should be by areas and not races.  The same thing applies to alcohol.  An Indian coolie can go and buy some liquor and have a drink with his friends.  A Burman may not.  At least not of licit liquor.  Therefore a great deal of illicit liquor is
[Line 1098] distilled.
[Line 1099]  Try to see how demoralising all this is.  Take a town like Sagaing, my last head-quarters, which is really only a big village, and note the results.  There is a liquor shop where European liquors, beer, and spirits are sold, and there are several shops where native spirits are sold.  A European, or half-caste, or Hindu, or Mohammedan of the better classes could go and buy a bottle of Bass or of Dyer's ale at the
[Line 1100] European shop and take it home for dinner.  The Burmese magistrates,
[Line 1101] inspectors of police, and so on could not--legally.  My Treasury
[Line 1102] officer, being a Burman, was debarred; his subordinate, a native of
[Line 1103] India, was not debarred.  What happens?  Well, I don't know.  But I
[Line 1104] bought a pony once from a very respectable and able Burmese Inspector of Police, and the first morning I rode him he took me gently but
[Line 1105] firmly to the back door of the liquor shop.  That gave me an idea, but I kept the idea to myself.  I have often had ideas of this nature. 
[Line 1106] Then take the poorer classes.  Is it good for one race of people to see
[Line 1107] another making merry with a glass while it is illegal for them to do so?  Does it not create bitterness, to say the least?  Does it not
[Line 1108] perpetuate differences that must disappear if self-government is to succeed?  Here, again, if laws are to succeed they must be in accordance with the desires of the people.  Only the people at large can stop smuggling.
[Line 1109] Read the history of how English smuggling was stopped; it was because no one could smuggle without being informed on--that is to say, public opinion had turned against them. 
[Line 1110] But that is not so in Burma.  Were prohibition of opium or spirits by
[Line 1111] localities where all were treated alike, you could ask the people to help you to enforce their wish.  But for opium and liquor to be sold to some and refused to others is not a local option.  No one likes it, and
[Line 1112] no one will help to stop smuggling.  That is human nature.  
[Line 1113] Government has been and is greatly abused for its opium and liquor
[Line 1114] policy, but I think if facts are looked at squarely it will be seen
[Line 1115] that the situation is very difficult.  The only way out that I can see
[Line 1116] is through local self-government.  If the scheme that I sketch out at the end of this book took form there would be local option eventually, and people will submit to what they themselves enact, whereas they
[Line 1117] chafe against the same thing when imposed from above.  That is human nature, and it is a very valuable trait of human nature.  It is the revolt against subjection, and the declaration that the objective of life is to be free.  The only morality of any value comes from within;
[Line 1118] that imposed from without may improve the body, but it enervates the soul.  Now the body is temporary and the soul eternal. 
[Line 1119]  Here I may end my criticism of the machinery of government.  Not that
[Line 1120] any of the other branches of the administration are better than those I
[Line 1121] have written of.  The land laws are, I think, worse, because they are based on imported fixed ideas and not on any careful investigation of
[Line 1122] facts and the underlying causes of facts.  The police administration is
[Line 1123] bad; the village administration worse than bad.  But I do not want to
[Line 1124] criticise; I want to establish my point, which is that the unrest in India is a legitimate unrest, that it is not factitious or political, but based on very real grievances that must grow till they are relieved.
[Line 1125] I have picked out these four branches of the administration: the Criminal and Civil Courts, the Villages, and the Opium and Excise, for specific reasons.  The reason I chose the first two is because no one
[Line 1126] ever seems to have suspected before how bad they were.  Everyone has gone on the fixed idea that because the magistrates and judges are
[Line 1127] honest and the law up to date there can be nothing to complain of in them.  The fault must be in the people.
[Line 1128]  Only as I write I get a letter to this effect from an officer of long
[Line 1129] experience.  He had "never seen anything wrong with the Courts." Therefore I have set out the facts to the best of my ability.  I want
[Line 1130] the reader to see for himself.  I don't want him to accept my authority
[Line 1131] that they are bad; I don't believe in authority.  I want him to think over the facts I have laid before him and frame his own judgment.  I think that he will see that the Courts which have been declared impregnable are very vulnerable indeed.  The reason I chose the Village is because it is the unit of
[Line 1132] self-government.  The reason I chose the Opium and Excise was different.  Whereas Government has never been criticised for its Courts and its law, which
[Line 1133] are bad, it has received unending criticism for its Opium and Excise
[Line 1134] policy.  Yet, mistakes apart, I don't see how it is much to blame.  The
[Line 1135] difficulties are inherent.  They are the same in nature as those that beset liquor legislation in England.  The question has not been solved
[Line 1136] here; far from it.  In fact, it is insoluble by Act; it is only soluble
[Line 1137] by education of the individual.  The right and temperate use of alcohol
[Line 1138] and drugs is a personal, not a State question.  Therefore where
[Line 1139] Government could have been criticised it was not, and where it did its
[Line 1140] best in great difficulties it was abused.  This will give a key to another difficulty in India: Government receives hardly any good and
[Line 1141] useful criticism from any side.  It is abused and praised, but that understanding criticism which is of the greatest value to individuals
[Line 1142] and Governments is wanting.  The Indians are feeling serious unrest,
[Line 1143] and they cannot diagnose the cause--no one can diagnose himself--so
[Line 1144] they strike out at random against Government measures and officials. They are like a certain party in England who also are unhappy with things as they are, and who express their dissatisfaction at, say, the
[Line 1145] marriage laws--which were made not by man, but by Churches, whose great
[Line 1146] supporters were and are women--by smashing the orchid house at Kew.  It reminds me of Andrew Lang's ghost.  What he wanted to say was that the drains were out of order and a danger to all the inhabitants of the
[Line 1147] castle.  But he suffered from aphasia, and the nearest he could get to an indication of his meaning was driving round and round the castle at midnight in a hearse and four. 
[Line 1148] Most changes arising in societies are incoherent in the same way, but
[Line 1149] it must not be supposed that because the expression is irrelevant there is no real and serious cause beneath it.  When an overboiling kettle spills and scalds the cat who never did the kettle any harm, it is hard
[Line 1150] luck on the cat, but it is not unnatural in the kettle.  And it would be dangerous therefore to stop up the spout.  Later on the kettle might explode and damage the cat's master. 
[Line 1151] The English papers in India want to support Government, which is right;
[Line 1152] but the best support they could give would be to point out where
[Line 1153] Government goes wrong and help it to go right.  They never do that,
[Line 1154] because the editors live in towns and know nothing of the country.
[Line 1155] Moreover, they too suffer from fixed ideas.  It is the same with the criticism the Indian Government gets from England.  There are here practically only two parties.  One says, "Sit
[Line 1156] tight on the safety-valve and shoot anyone who comes near you"; and the other says "Give government to the people."  Now there is no organised Indian people as yet to give it to.  No Government has ever had so little help from intelligent criticism as
[Line 1157] the Indian Government; none ever needed it more.  No Government in the
[Line 1158] world is more sincerely desirous of the good of the people it governs; none knows so little how to secure it. 
[Line 1159] You cannot have any work done efficiently unless there is honest and
[Line 1160] understanding criticism.  No sensible person objects to it if it is
[Line 1161] given sincerely and fairly.  But that is not so in India.  Considering how unfair most criticism of the Indian Government is, it shows great self-restraint in the consideration it accords to it.  And you can't
[Line 1162] expect Government officials to criticise themselves.  It isn't part of their functions and it isn't fair to ask it.  Their duty is to carry out the laws and orders they receive.  They have neither the time nor the attitude of mind to be always criticising them.
[Line 1163] But there ought to be somebody whose function is to investigate the working of government, and to suggest and criticise.  In England it used to be done--badly--by Parliament and the papers.  Now no one does
[Line 1164] it: everyone now only seeks "party" advantage.  In China there used to be censors whose duty it was, I am told, to watch the working of the machine and criticise it.  That would be an admirable idea if it could
[Line 1165] be carried out. 
[Line 1166] The Government of India should have censors.  They should be well paid, and I think their lives would have to be heavily insured.  Their
[Line 1167] reports should not be pigeon-holed, but published.
[Line 1168] At present this ill-informed criticism of Government has succeeded in
[Line 1169] achieving one and is pressing another measure for the alleviation of
[Line 1170] the unrest which can do nothing but harm.  The danger is that Government, not knowing the right thing to do and pressed to do
[Line 1171] something, will accept these measures rather than be accused of ignoring the unrest.
[Line 1172]  India is lost to us--lost in spirit, and only awaiting the opportunity to be lost in substance.  How shall she be regained?
[Line 1173] Government have two ideas.  Let us see what these are. 
[Line 1174] PART II 
[Line 1175] COUNSELS OF DESPAIR 
[Line 1176] CHAPTER X
[Line 1177] THE COUNCILS  The first step that has been taken with the hope of allaying the
[Line 1178] discontent in India has been the increase in the Councils of the Government of India and of the Local Governments of Madras and Bombay, with the creation of Councils in the other Provinces which did not have them before.
[Line 1179]  And as these Councils have been in certain quarters greatly praised as being not only good in themselves now but as containing the germs of
[Line 1180] great possibilities, it is necessary to consider them carefully.  Councils were first instituted in India in 1861, were enlarged in 1892, and again much enlarged in 1909; thus they are no new thing, and their value is already fairly obvious.  Moreover, since the enlargements of
[Line 1181] the Act of 1909 some time has elapsed, so that I am not here
[Line 1182] criticising institutions which have not yet had a chance of showing what they can do.
[Line 1183] There are Executive Councils for the Government of India and for the Provincial Governments of Bombay and Madras, and there are Legislative Councils for the Government of India and for each Province.
[Line 1184] The whole of the law for the constitution of these Councils is contained in the Indian Councils Acts of 1861, 1892, and 1909, and the
[Line 1185] Rules for the nomination or election of the members are contained in Blue Book Number Cd 6714, published in 1913.  I give these references
[Line 1186] in order that anyone who cares to go into the subject in greater detail than I can in this chapter will be able to find all his material readily.  He will be able to see how other Councils than those I intend
[Line 1187] to deal with here are constituted; also in what way and by what constituencies elected members are chosen.  There is a great deal that
[Line 1188] might well be said on each of these Councils. 
[Line 1189] But the only Councils I propose to deal with here are those of the
[Line 1190] Government of India and of the Province of Burma.  I would have liked to include the Council of Madras but that I think the subject can be fairly understood without this. 
[Line 1191] The Executive Council of the Government of India consists of the Governor-General and nine members.  These form the Cabinet of India, and, subject to the control of the Secretary of State, it has supreme power.  It includes the Commander-in-Chief and members for Finance, Public Works, Home affairs and so on.  The only alteration made in this Council is by declaring that one of the members must be an Indian.  So far that member has been the Law Member, and it is somewhat difficult to see how any other post could be filled by an Indian.  You can find Indian lawyers, many, perhaps too
[Line 1192] many of them, but where are you to find Indians with that necessary
[Line 1193] experience that would fit them to be Finance or Home Members or Commander-in-Chief, for instance?  The appointment of this Indian gentleman to be Law Member has not been followed by any striking results.  Law in India is petrified, and until
[Line 1194] the great reform takes place petrified it must remain.  It does not
[Line 1195] seem to matter very much who is head of it.  When reform comes it will
[Line 1196] not be an Indian who could undertake it.
[Line 1197] The Legislative Council is formed of the Executive Council and
[Line 1198] Additional Members.  Before 1909, Additional Members were few, they were nominated and there was always a good Government majority.  Since
[Line 1199] 1909 it has been constituted as follows:
[Line 1200]   Nominated Members
[Line 1201]   28 officials
[Line 1202]   5 non-officials.
[Line 1203]  Of these five non-officials one is to represent the Indian Commercial community, one the Mohammedans of the Punjab, and one the landowners in
[Line 1204] the Punjab.  The other two nominated members may be anyone apparently.
[Line 1205] Then there are twenty-seven elected members; two each to represent the
[Line 1206] four large Provincial Councils; one each for the five smaller Provinces, one each to represent the landowners of six Provinces; five
[Line 1207] representatives of Mohammedans in these five Provinces; one member each to the Chambers of Commerce of Bengal and Bombay; and one extra
[Line 1208] Mohammedan member.  Thus in this assembly there are represented in a way nine Provinces as wholes, the landowning class of some Provinces, one religion and the trade of two cities. 
[Line 1209] To make it clearer to the reader who has not been to India, let me put
[Line 1210] it in this way.  India is as big as Europe without Russia, and has three hundred million inhabitants, more than Europe.  Suppose Europe
[Line 1211] were conquered and administered by Martians, and they were to establish a Council.  If they did it on similar principles to this Legislative Council of the Government of India it would consist of: 
[Line 1212] Two members each for Germany, France, Great Britain, and Italy, one member each for five smaller nations, one representative each for the landowners in Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and
[Line 1213] Spain, five representatives of Protestants as Protestants, and one each for the Chambers of Commerce of London and Paris. 
[Line 1214] What would the reader think of this as a Council to make laws for all
[Line 1215] Europe?  What would he say?  I think he would say many things.  He
[Line 1216] would also ask some questions.  He would ask: 
[Line 1217] Firstly, how can two members represent great countries--like England
[Line 1218] for instance?  Or one represent another great area and people like Spain?  Is it conceivably possible that one or at best two individuals could have the necessary knowledge or impartiality to do this?
[Line 1219]  His second question would be: How can one man represent landowners spread over a great territory with different forms of tenure, different
[Line 1220] crops, different climates, different nationalities?  His third would be: Two cities are represented; where are the others?  His fourth would be: At best, all these members can but represent, in even ever so faint a way, their own class who elects them.  Say at a
[Line 1221] liberal estimate that they represent more or less imperfectly half a million people; what about the two hundred and ninety-nine and a half
[Line 1222] million who are left out?  Who are to protect tenants from landlords, the innumerable unrepresented religions from that one which is
[Line 1223] represented, the voiceless cities from the two which have voices?  In
[Line 1224] fact, who is to protect Europe from these few privileged classes? 
[Line 1225] That would be analogous to what is happening in India.  These questions
[Line 1226] are being asked.
[Line 1227]  The answer to the first question is quite simple.  The two members do not represent Madras, nor does the one member represent Burma.  They represent the non-officials of the Local Council, and that is all; that is to say, ten or fifteen individuals of much their own class and
[Line 1228] standing.  It is not likely that they have any knowledge of the country they are to represent, except the chief town.  It is quite certain that
[Line 1229] they have never even travelled over half their country, nor speak more than one or two of the various tongues.  They have no knowledge of the administration anywhere, nor any
[Line 1230] administrative ability.  If a question vital to their Province arose they would not know what to do; and if they did know they would not dare to do it if it involved any responsibility, because they have no
[Line 1231] backing in the country supposed to be theirs.  They are totally
[Line 1232] unknown, even by name, to nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand inhabitants.  In fact, even this is an over-estimate.  They are not only without knowledge of the immense majority of "their"
[Line 1233] people, but are antagonistic in race and religion to many of them, so
[Line 1234] that it is only the English Government that keeps the peace.
[Line 1235]  The answer to the second question is much the same as to the first.
[Line 1236] Fancy one member representing the Nair landholders of Malabar, the Poligars, the Tamils, the Telugu landholders, and many others.  It is absurd.  There is no answer to the third question.
[Line 1237] The answer to the fourth is that whatever help and representation and defence the bulk of India can obtain must be obtained from the English
[Line 1238] official members.  They alone are quite impartial; they may be comparatively ignorant, but their ignorance is light compared to that
[Line 1239] of the native members, for it includes a knowledge of administration
[Line 1240] obtained by experience, which none of the latter have.  It is we alone who have raised the people economically, and have done it often enough against the influence of class.
[Line 1241]  Therefore the Council of the Government of India is so constituted that whereas perhaps half a million people are represented directly or
[Line 1242] indirectly by class and religion, the two hundred and ninety-nine and a
[Line 1243] half million have no representation at all and must depend on the
[Line 1244] English officials.  This is no new discovery of mine.  Here is what Lord Curzon said in the debate in the House of Lords on this new Act: "I wonder how these changes will in the last resort affect the great mass of the people of
[Line 1245] India--the people who have no vote and have scarcely a voice.  Remember that to these people, who form the bulk of the population of India, representative government and electoral institutions are nothing whatever.  I have a misgiving that this class will not fare much better
[Line 1246] under these changes than they do now.  At any rate, I see no place for
[Line 1247] them in these enlarged Councils which are to be created, and I am under the strong opinion that as government in India becomes more and more Parliamentary--as will be the inevitable result--so it will become less
[Line 1248] paternal and less beneficial to the poorer classes of the population."
[Line 1249] It was seen that these Councils were merely by way of handing over the India we have made to a tiny section of privileged classes whom we were
[Line 1250] to keep in power and support with our bayonets.  It was seen and disregarded.  Why?
[Line 1251] So much for its constitution.  Every principle that experience shows must go to the making of a successful Assembly has been scorned.  The
[Line 1252] representation, even such as it is, is by class, by race, and by religion.  No assembly where such a method of representation has been adopted has ever been known.  Wherever, even in a small degree, such
[Line 1253] differences have existed it has paralysed all action.  Take, for instance, the French National Assembly before the Revolution.  Imagine a House of Commons with members for landowners, for the merchants of
[Line 1254] London and Glasgow, and special members for the Catholic Irish in
[Line 1255] England and Scotland.  Even that would be far less extraordinary than
[Line 1256] the Council of India. 
[Line 1257] This Council has no executive powers, but it can ask questions: it can discuss the Budget though it cannot make alterations; it can make laws
[Line 1258] affecting all India.  But all it does is subject to veto by the Government of India--and naturally so.  How could you delegate real
[Line 1259] power to a Council which, the English officials apart, has no
[Line 1260] representative value of any kind and no administrative experience?  The
[Line 1261] power behind the Government is the power of England--the Army, the
[Line 1262] Navy, and the wealth of England.  It is administered by British
[Line 1263] officials, and even the native army is officered by English officers.
[Line 1264] Is this great English organism to be used for enforcing laws passed by
[Line 1265] such a Council as that I have described?  To be at its mercy, to be its servant?  Does it enter into the possibility of things?
[Line 1266]  The Council, the officials apart, is in reality at its very best advisory only.  It cannot be more.  It has no power behind it and could be given no responsibility.  Yet without the fear of responsibility
[Line 1267] what advice is ever well given?  Irresponsible advisers!  Of what value have they ever been in the world's history?
[Line 1268] "But"--I have been told and have read often enough--"the Council works
[Line 1269] well, it is a success, it has gratified the educated Indian.  Why
[Line 1270] criticise it, then?"  To that I reply, "In what has its success consisted--what has it done?"  And to that I never get any answer
[Line 1271] except that it is a success because it has done nothing.  The speakers
[Line 1272] were afraid, apparently, it might try to do something--to express, for instance, some of the desires and needs of the people, a few of which I have tried to explain in this book; to suggest some new policy to
[Line 1273] Government, to show how the great and increasing unrest might be guided
[Line 1274] into safe channels; and it has been a success because it has done none
[Line 1275] of these things and was capable of doing none of them.  It has been as an influence _nil_.  All it has done has been empty criticism.  A writer trying to praise it says: "The debates in the Imperial Council are already not unworthy of older and more famous assemblies."  If the
[Line 1276] comparison is with the House of Commons it is not inapt.  For many
[Line 1277] years now debates there have been merely a pretence.  The conclusions are already fixed and the speakers know it.  They speak to pass time,
[Line 1278] to satisfy the electors that they are really doing something to justify
[Line 1279] their existence, and they try to show off--or to score off someone else.  Their speeches have no value.  They make no difference to the
[Line 1280] result.  And the debates in the India Council are no different.  It perhaps gives the members the illusion of power and authority to be
[Line 1281] able to badger Government and make long speeches, but it can effect
[Line 1282] nothing.  The debates are make-believe.  How should they be anything else?  The men are not to blame, but the institution.
[Line 1283]  "But"--again say its advocates--"this is but a beginning.  The Council
[Line 1284] is but in embryo.  Wait till it comes to greater maturity."
[Line 1285]  To what greater maturity can it come?  Is there in this Council any true idea that can expand and grow?  There is no idea at all.  Is it ever contemplated to make it really representative?  How many members would it take to represent three hundred millions of people?  On the
[Line 1286] British basis, not a liberal one, it would require an assembly of over
[Line 1287] four thousand five hundred members.  Is that possible?  Is any election possible among the masses of the people? 
[Line 1288] Is it ever possible that real executive or legislative power should be
[Line 1289] given to an assembly when it is the English Government and the English people who in the last resort would have to carry out those orders and bear the brunt of their failure? 
[Line 1290] Think over the facts carefully.  Could you make a central Parliament to govern all Europe?  No.  For a hundred reasons the idea is impossible.
[Line 1291] It is equally impossible in India.  It is even more impossible in India
[Line 1292] than it would be in Europe. 
[Line 1293] Finally it is said that this Council has satisfied the educated class in India.
[Line 1294]  Has it?
[Line 1295] And if it had could there be a greater criterion of its worthlessness
[Line 1296] than such satisfaction?
[Line 1297]  Let us now turn to the Burma Provincial Council.  There is no Executive
[Line 1298] Council, all executive power lies with the Lieut.-Governor.  The
[Line 1299] Legislative Council consists of seventeen members.
[Line 1300]  One member is elected by the Chamber of Commerce, and the other sixteen
[Line 1301] are nominated.  Of these sixteen, six may be officials; two experts may
[Line 1302] be official or non-official; the rest must be non-official; of these,
[Line 1303] four must be Burmese, one must be Chinese, and one must be Indian.
[Line 1304] The Council has power to enact local legislation for Burma only.  That
[Line 1305] is to say it can pass special or local laws.  It cannot, of course,
[Line 1306] interfere with or vary the Imperial legislation, such as the Indian Penal Codes.  Its powers are small and are limited.  It is, as will be seen, representative of nothing.  Except the officials, none of the members have any administrative knowledge; none are known to the people at large even by name.  That they approved or passed any Act modifying,
[Line 1307] say, the Burmese law of inheritance, would be no justification for it
[Line 1308] before the people.  They represent neither people nor ideas.  They have
[Line 1309] effected nothing and can effect nothing because they have no force
[Line 1310] behind them.  What have any of them ever done that the people should repose confidence in them?
[Line 1311]  For the rest the same criticisms apply as to the Indian Council.  The Lieut.-Governor has all the executive power and he has the power of veto over all legislation.  Naturally he must have this power.  If not, he might be forced into using British power and authority and means for
[Line 1312] enforcing Acts that he disapproved of and were passed by men who represented at best not one thousandth part of the country. 
[Line 1313] Yet, as long as he has this power of veto, the Council, like the Indian Council, becomes simply an advisory Council with no responsibility. And, again, of what value is advice that is not steadied by the sense
[Line 1314] of responsibility?  And with all this talk of self-government, of an Imperial Indian
[Line 1315] Parliament and local parliaments, of election and representation, there is in no village in the Indian Empire any self-government at all, even
[Line 1316] in the smallest matters.  The villages are one and all under the rule of a Government official, and every vestige of self-government has been destroyed.  India may have representatives in the India Council and a voice, even if an impotent voice, in Imperial matters, but it may have no representation in its Village Council, and no voice in the smallest
[Line 1317] village concern. 
[Line 1318] The whole base on which any self-government could rest has been
[Line 1319] destroyed.  And instead of building up from below a system of self-government that would proceed from the people and be so founded as
[Line 1320] to stand any shocks, it is sought to begin self-government from the top, by suspending in the air Councils that rest on nothing, that mean nothing, that have as much solidity and reality as kites would have.
[Line 1321]  This, too, must have been foreseen, because it is obvious.  Why, then,
[Line 1322] was it done?
[Line 1323] Was there ever in any history a _reductio ad absurdum_ like these Councils of Despair?  
[Line 1324]   CHAPTER XI
[Line 1325] THE INDIAN AS CIVILIAN
[Line 1326] The next measure which has insistently been pressed on the Government
[Line 1327] is that far more Indians should be admitted to the Civil Service.  It
[Line 1328] is now composed almost exclusively of Englishmen, and the conditions
[Line 1329] are such that it is difficult for Indians to enter.  This, it is claimed, should be altered, and the Civil Service should be to a great
[Line 1330] extent Indianised.
[Line 1331] Well, as I have said, the Government of India is not Indian, it is
[Line 1332] English.  It is essentially English, the more so and the more
[Line 1333] necessarily so because it is in India.  It consists of very few members
[Line 1334] compared to the work it has to do, and it is of the highest importance therefore that it be completely efficient.  England has made herself
[Line 1335] responsible for India, and she cannot shirk or divide this responsibility.  She cannot say: "I will by admitting a few Indians into the service shift some of the responsibility onto them and so onto India."  That is unthinkable.  The Government of India is English, and until by revolution or devolution it disappears it must remain English. It is the Army and Navy of England which ensure India's safety. Therefore her first duty, not only to herself but to India, is to enlist in her superior service such men as will govern most efficiently.
[Line 1336]  Now to govern efficiently we must govern in our own way.  There are not for us nor any people two ways of doing a thing well; there is one way
[Line 1337] only possible at the time--one way in which the genius of the governing race can best express itself.  That is the one we must follow, and to ensure its success we must have in the service men who are not merely by education, but by what is far more important, by instinct, best fitted to carry out the ideas of government.  You must have officers
[Line 1338] who will know what to do not only when they are told, but when they are
[Line 1339] not told, who, being one in race and feeling with the Government, will instinctively do all in accordance with it.  For it must never be forgotten that the government of India is a very difficult matter, and will always be so.  It is not plain-sailing, like the Local Government of any self-governing people, or even of Russia. The administration of India is alien.  The system is alien; and though
[Line 1340] it need not be so much out of touch with the people as it is now, alien it must remain.  As long as the government is alien the machinery must
[Line 1341] be so.  Englishmen could not work machinery they did not understand.
[Line 1342] Even in self-governed countries there is always a feeling against
[Line 1343] government.  Taxes are hard things to bear.  This is shown in socialism and many other ways.  But in an alien-governed country like India this discontent is much greater.  Government has not only to bear the blame
[Line 1344] for its own faults, but has to vicariously suffer for the shortcomings of the monsoons and the inroad of plague.  It is responsible, in the people's ideas, for everything.  The internal peace which is taken for
[Line 1345] granted in most European countries cannot be so assumed in India.  We are very often within measurable distance of riot, and an unchecked
[Line 1346] riot may quickly develop into an insurrection.  The first essential, therefore, of government is the maintenance of peace and the immediate suppression of any symptom of unrest. 
[Line 1347] Now the forces at the disposal of the authorities are not large.  For
[Line 1348] the whole province of Burma, as large as France and England, and with a
[Line 1349] thousand miles of wild frontier and ten millions of people, there are only four British and eight Indian regiments.  There are, or were,
[Line 1350] besides (I have not the latest figures) some ten thousand military police, who are men recruited in India and officered by English
[Line 1351] officers from Indian regiments.  The Burmese police are only for civil
[Line 1352] duty and detection.  They are not for "keeping the peace" purposes.
[Line 1353] For the whole of India there are but 70,000 British troops and 140,000 native for a population of 350,000,000, with a difficult and turbulent
[Line 1354] frontier.  There is manifestly no margin to waste; the resources
[Line 1355] available must be used with the utmost efficiency.  There must be
[Line 1356] direct understanding and co-operation between the military officers who command the forces and the District Officers who supply the information, the intelligence and the direction.  Now if the District Officer were an Indian this could not be.  It is no reflection on either the courage or the capacity of the Indian to say this, for the quality necessary is neither of these.  It is one which he does not and
[Line 1357] cannot have, but which is essential for the proper carrying out of his duties.  It is _camaraderie_ with the other officers.  Official relations between civil and military are always difficult.  It
[Line 1358] is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules defining their respective
[Line 1359] responsibilities.  There is a certain antagonism between the objects each wishes to attain and the way to attain them.  The civilian wishes
[Line 1360] as far as possible to avoid bloodshed; to soothe, not irritate, nor
[Line 1361] threaten.  Fighting is the last thing he wants.  The soldier, on the other hand, wants to get at his enemy and have it over; to stir him up
[Line 1362] if he be not already stirred up enough.  He wishes action that is short, sharp, and decisive.  The civilian is long-suffering.  Therefore
[Line 1363] disagreements arise, and that these conflicts of official opinion should be minimised, something more is necessary than that the men on both sides be good officers.  They must be friends.  The rubs of
[Line 1364] official intercourse must be effaced over the mess-table, the card-table, the camp fire; must be forgotten in talks of home, of
[Line 1365] mutual friends.  How often has it not happened that it has been the mutual appreciation of a poet, the remembrance of a charming woman, the
[Line 1366] admiration of an opera, that has rendered possible that co-operation which is the soul of work.  There must be the continual consciousness on both sides that theirs is not a temporary official relationship.
[Line 1367] They will meet continually hereafter at other stations, at head-quarters, at dinners, races, clubs--in the East and at home.  They must be friends all through; there must be a mutual understanding.  Now if the civilian were an Indian gentleman all this could not occur.
[Line 1368] That Indians are often honourable and cultured gentlemen I know; that
[Line 1369] in essence all humanity is one I am never tired of affirming.  But there are differences of race, real differences, important differences,
[Line 1370] differences that the Indian himself should be the last to try to ignore.  Every nation is given by nature the qualities peculiar to it
[Line 1371] and which it is its duty to cultivate for the world's sake.  To attempt to sink your individuality in that of another is an injury not only to
[Line 1372] yourself but to the whole world.  An Indian gentleman cannot be an Englishman.  It is no use his trying.  He only makes himself absurd. He can be something quite as good if he will cultivate his own talent; but he has not our talent.  He is not an Englishman, and only an
[Line 1373] Englishman by birth has that _camaraderie_ with other Englishmen that is essential.  Even a Frenchman or a German would not have it. Therefore it would be impossible to place Indian civilians in places where co-operation with military or military police-officers would be
[Line 1374] essential.  Further, it is not the English officers alone who create the difficulty.  It is the men--English and native.  Men of fighting races
[Line 1375] in India will not acknowledge the authority of Indians of other
[Line 1376] nationalities, even if supported by Government.
[Line 1377]  I will tell a story in illustration. 
[Line 1378] I was stationed nearly twenty years ago at a district head-quarters in
[Line 1379] Burma where there was a battalion of Military Police recruited in Upper
[Line 1380] India.  There was also a young Mohammedan civilian who had passed into
[Line 1381] the Civil Service in London and been posted to Burma.  He was an
[Line 1382] excellent fellow in his way.  It happened one morning that I rode down to the Battalion Commandant's house to see him on some matter.  We discussed our business, and after it was finished the Subadar of the battalion, a great soldierly Sikh, came in.  He and the Commandant talked for a while, and when he was leaving E. said:
[Line 1383]  "By the by, Subadar Sahib, we are coming up this evening to the range
[Line 1384] to do a little firing.  Send up the marker and four rifles." 
[Line 1385] "_Four_ rifles?" queried the Subadar.  E. nodded.
[Line 1386]  "For whom?" 
[Line 1387] "For the four Sahibs," said E.
[Line 1388]  The Subadar counted.  "The Deputy Sahib, Huzoor (E.), Hall Sahib, and
[Line 1389] who else?' 
[Line 1390] "Oh," said he, "Mahommed V. Sahib," naming the Indian civilian.
[Line 1391] The Subadar turned away with a gesture of scorn.  "A sahib? he?" he growled.
